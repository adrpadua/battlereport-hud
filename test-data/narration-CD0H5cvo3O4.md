# Turn 1

## [Drukhari] Turn 1 (Attacker) — Movement / Shooting / Charges / Fight

- **[UNIT:Scout Squad]** [5:35–5:47]: Grey Knights scout moves noted as part of deployment conversation — both sides had scouting actions (Grey Knights placed one Strike Squad into cover and one Scout onto an objective; Drukhari placed [UNIT:Lady Malys] into the pocket) [5:35–5:49].  
  (Context: deployment/scouting described; specific moves by Grey Knights and Drukhari scouts are described at 5:44–5:49 and 5:46–5:49.)

- **[UNIT:Wyches]** [3:04–3:06, 3:59–4:06, 8:00–8:06]: One small unit of [UNIT:Wyches] was set up in the [UNIT:Venom] and another unit remained on the table to contest mid objectives; one deep-strike unit of [UNIT:Wyches] and a [UNIT:Venom] were placed in reserve/deep strike [3:57–4:06, 4:04–4:12]. The [UNIT:Wyches] inside the [UNIT:Raider] were used to "stick" an objective with the transport's nose on the objective [3:18–3:24].

- **[UNIT:Scourge with Dark Lances]** [3:11–3:13]: A unit of [UNIT:Scourge] with [UNIT:Dark Lances] was placed in the backline and later fired in the shooting phase; their Dark Lance shots would be used to engage Grey Knight vehicles/armored targets [3:11–3:13, 9:21–9:29].

- **[UNIT:Scourge]** [9:21–9:27]: During shooting, a [UNIT:Scourge] using [UNIT:Dark Lances] killed one [UNIT:Inceptor] ("I killed one [UNIT:Inceptor] with a [UNIT:Dark Lance]") and then destroyed the [UNIT:Razorback] with Dark Lances ("I did kill the Razback with this unit of [UNIT:Dark Lance] [UNIT:Scourge]") [9:21–9:27].

- **[UNIT:Kabalite Warriors]** [9:38–9:46]: The disembarked [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors] hopped out and used a grenade (and subsequent attacks) to put five [UNIT:Devastating Wounds] onto the [UNIT:Caladius Grav Tank] / Kalidus target and did heavy damage to the Grey Knights' Librarian (the Kabalites "grenaded the [UNIT:Caladius Grav Tank] to death, doing five [UNIT:Devastating Wounds]" and then used [UNIT:Sustained Assault] to damage the librarian heavily) [9:38–9:46, 9:53–10:03].

- **[UNIT:Archon Scari] + [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors]** [9:41–10:05]: The commentary states the [UNIT:Archon Scari] with the Kabalites rolled multiple attacks (sustained assault with four rerolls) and inflicted multiple wounds on the Grey Knights' librarian, followed by Dark Lances finishing the last wounds ("they did three hits with the little blast pistol ... the ignore cover darks took seven wounds ... Dark Lances finished off the last three wounds") [9:46–10:10].

- **[UNIT:Hand of the Archon]** / **[UNIT:Lady Malys]** (preparation) [6:03–6:07, 6:49–6:54]: Drukhari set [UNIT:Hand of the Archon] and [UNIT:Wyches] to hold/terraform objectives this turn ("I did Terraforming Points that objective ... with the [UNIT:Hand of the Archon] half and this objective with the [UNIT:Wyches]") [10:18–10:23].

- **[UNIT:Lady Malys]** [10:49–11:40]: Charged a Grey Knight [UNIT:Purifier Squad] and "absolutely annihilated that unit" — the narration details she scored three sustained hits and three [UNIT:Devastating Wounds], producing three lethals and wiping the Purifiers; she then consolidated and used [UNIT:Wraithlike Retreat] to re-embark into her [UNIT:Venom] ("[UNIT:Lady Malys] ... absolutely annihilated that unit ... used wraithlike retreat after they consolidated to move seven in and get back into the [UNIT:Venom]") [10:49–11:40].

- Scoring after Turn 1: Drukhari scored [UNIT:Terraforming Points] and other early gains; Grey Knights had "recover assets" and [OBJECTIVE:Bring It Down] points noted (end-of-turn tallies referenced) [11:52–12:04].

Summary Turn 1 result: Drukhari destroyed at least one Grey Knights transport ([UNIT:Razorback]) and one [UNIT:Inceptor], killed the Grey Knights' [UNIT:Kalidus Assassin] earlier (?) — see Turn 2 for Kalidus death — and Lady Malys eliminated a Purifier squad by charge [9:21–9:27; 10:49–11:40].

# Turn 1

## [Grey Knights] Turn 1 — Movement / Shooting / Charges / Fight

- **[UNIT:Castellan Crow]** [6:27–6:30]: Advanced up the table as noted in the end-of-turn movement summary ("We had [UNIT:Castellan Crow] advance up") [6:27–6:30].

- **[UNIT:Strike Squad]** [6:31–6:33, 4:35–4:50]: One unit moved into/behind a wall and another Strike Squad scouted onto an objective (scouting/secure) [6:31–6:33, 4:48–4:51].

- **[UNIT:Inceptor Squad] / [UNIT:Interceptors]** [6:33–6:37, 1:56–1:59]: One Inceptor unit moved up and Terraforming Points were placed on a mid objective by Inceptors (the narrator: "This [UNIT:Inceptor] unit move up and [UNIT:Terraforming Points] this objective. This objective is now sticky") [6:33–6:37].

- **[UNIT:Razorback]** [6:37–6:39]: Advanced forward in support of the Strike Marines and objective control ("The [UNIT:Razorback] has advanced forward") [6:37–6:39] — later destroyed by Drukhari [9:23–9:27].

- **[UNIT:Librarian Zarek]** and **[UNIT:Kalidus Assassin]** [6:39–6:49, 4:25–4:32]: The librarian and Kalidus moved forward aggressively; Kalidus infiltrated upfront during deployment [4:25–4:32]; Kalidus later gets called dead at [10:31–10:41] (see Turn 1 Drukhari shooting) — the Drukhari narration confirms "dead [UNIT:Kalidus]" [10:31–10:41].

- End of Turn 1 summary for Grey Knights: Movement concentrated to hold objectives and shelter heavy hitters ([UNIT:Purifier Squad], [UNIT:Techmarine], [UNIT:Dreadknight] stayed safe) [6:47–6:54].

# Turn 2

## [Grey Knights] Turn 2 — Movement / Shooting / Charges / Fight

- Cards/mission: Grey Knights picked up cards [12:11–12:19]; priorities included [OBJECTIVE:Defend Stronghold] and [OBJECTIVE:No Prisoners] to kill small Drukhari units [12:11–12:19].

- **[UNIT:Grand Master] (Grey Knights)** [15:01–15:04]: In the shooting phase, a Grey Knights [UNIT:Grand Master] used [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] on wound rolls and "just nuked" a unit of [UNIT:Wyches] — full annihilation was described ("used the [UNIT:Stratagem] to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] wound rolls of one and then just nuked this unit of [UNIT:Wyches] ... Dead.") [15:01–15:04].

- **[UNIT:Purifier Squad]** vs **[UNIT:Reaver Jetbike]** [15:13–15:18]: A [UNIT:Reaver Jetbike] survived a heavy volley from a Grey Knights [UNIT:Purifier Squad] and lived on one wound despite "a billion storm bolter shots" and rerolls [15:13–15:18].

- **[UNIT:Dreadknight]** [15:36–15:39]: A Grey Knights [UNIT:Dreadknight] attempted to engage the Reaver Jetbikes but "couldn't see the bikes anymore" and so failed to finish them off [15:36–15:39].

- **[UNIT:Purifier Squad] (flamer/melt)** fired at a [UNIT:Venom] and did some wounds but the Venom survived with three wounds — the flamers did three wounds and the meltagun failed to hit and wound even with rerolls [15:41–15:52].

- Charge attempts: Grey Knights attempted charges (notably a big charge attempt that failed — a roll of four for a 9" needed, failing) [16:11–17:27]. The failed charge profoundly affected plans and caused visible player frustration [16:11–17:27].

- End-of-turn scoring: Grey Knights gained points on secondaries/recoveries and spent CPs accordingly [18:22–18:39].

---

# Turn 2

## [Drukhari] Turn 2 — Movement / Shooting / Charges / Fight

- Command and deployment: Drukhari had 3 CP to 2 CP [19:11–19:15]; Drukhari declared [OBJECTIVE:Assassination] and [OBJECTIVE:Display of Might] among others [19:28–19:35].

- **[UNIT:Grand Master] (Grey Knights) in Reserve / Rapid Ingress** [19:35–23:01]: Drukhari used [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress] on a Grey Knights [UNIT:Grand Master] in strategic reserve to heroically intervene later (commentary: "You [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress] this guy right here to heroically intervene threat for free... used his [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress] there") [19:35–23:01].

- Movement/disembarks: Drukhari used 6" disembark from the [UNIT:Raider] for a [UNIT:Wyches] block to put them into action [21:42–21:48].

- **[UNIT:Lelith Hesperax]** [22:05–22:11]: Disembarked as part of the more aggressive push but stayed outside 6" of Grey Knight Purifiers to avoid mortal wounds from certain Auras (keeping safe from psychic/aoe) [22:05–22:11].

- **[UNIT:Scourges / Dark Lances]** [23:11–24:12]: During mid-shooting Drukhari reported killing some [UNIT:Strike Squad] and [UNIT:Purifier Squad] elements and using a free [STRATAGEM:Grenade] to good effect; specifically, a [STRATAGEM:Grenade] did four damage to a [UNIT:Grand Master] (and combined with a Dark Lance and other fire reduced a Grand Master to three wounds) — the caster rolled a four-wound Dark Lance reducing the target to three wounds [23:54–24:15].

- **[UNIT:Dark Lances]** [24:07–24:15]: Dark Lances finally stripped off remaining wounds from a Grey Knights heavy unit during the shooting phase (narrator: "I have a [UNIT:Dark Lance] that you failed your save... I just kill you with my [UNIT:Dark Lance]... A four wounds. You're down to three wounds.") [24:07–24:15].

- **[UNIT:Archon] + Assault charges** [24:44–25:06]: Drukhari charged into a exposed Grey Knights block — the narrator set up cascading combat plans (charge with [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax] and Archon to enable pile-ins) [24:52–25:06].

- **[UNIT:Lady Malys]** [24:56–25:33]: Heroic intervene-like interaction: [UNIT:Lady Malys] hero-intervened in melee and "killed the techmarine and all the [UNIT:Purifier Squad] literally by herself" — the commentator repeats "she just did another three sustained lethal hits" and confirms kills [24:56–25:33].

- **[UNIT:Incubi]** [25:41–25:52]: [UNIT:Incubi] killed an opposing unit in the melee exchange ("The [UNIT:Incubi] killed that unit") [25:41–25:52].

- **[UNIT:Lelith Hesperax]** [26:00–27:04]: Piled in and fought a leftover [UNIT:Purifier Squad] and achieved heavy kills, but later suffered devastating wounds from Grey Knight Devastating Wounds and died — narrator: "two die, and two devs GO ONTO [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax]" and "YES, FOR THE EMPEROR. NO, you got her. She's dead." [26:46–27:04].

- **[UNIT:Raider] / [UNIT:Venom]** [27:19–27:33]: Drukhari used [UNIT:Wraithlike Retreat] for safe extraction/embarkation after fights — [UNIT:Lady Malys] and a Hand unit used Wraithlike Retreat to re-embark into their [UNIT:Venom] and a [UNIT:Raider] ("I'm spending my 1 [UNIT:Command Point] to wraith like retreat ... embark into said [UNIT:Raider] ... pop back into said [UNIT:Venom]") [27:19–27:33].

- Scoring: Drukhari collected [OBJECTIVE:Display of Might] and a five-point assassination in the post-fight scoreboard; their total rose accordingly (narrator: "I will get [OBJECTIVE:Display of Might] for four points and a five point assassination ... go up to 13 [UNIT:Terraforming Points]" ) [28:14–28:22].

---

# Turn 3

## [Grey Knights] Turn 3 — Movement / Shooting / Charges / Fight

- Command points/cards: Grey Knights regained CP and played defensively, selected cards like [OBJECTIVE:Extend Battle Lines]/[UNIT:Locus of Power] earlier [28:40–31:21].

- **[UNIT:Castellan Crow]** [29:00–29:04]: Moved up into more aggressive position ("you move this guy up. [UNIT:Castellan Crow]'s like, YOU KNOW WHAT? FOR GLORY") [29:00–29:04]. Later, he is targeted and killed by Drukhari shooting (see Drukhari Turn 3) [33:25–33:28].

- **[UNIT:Purifier Squad]** / **[UNIT:Incubi]** [30:17–30:21]: Grey Knights' [UNIT:Castellan Crow] and two [UNIT:Purifier Squad] killed all the [UNIT:Incubi] ("[UNIT:Castellan Crow] and his two [UNIT:Purifier Squad] killed all the [UNIT:Incubi]") [30:17–30:21].

- **[UNIT:Raider] / Meltagun action** [30:09–30:27]: A Grey Knights meltagun (or similar) engaged and killed a [UNIT:Venom] — "you do kill this [UNIT:Venom] with the [UNIT:Meltagun]. You put that [UNIT:Venom] down to one single wound with a volley of storm bolt of fire from hallowed ground" [30:09–30:27].

- Psychic: A Grey Knights psychic cannon inflicted damage to enemy units earlier in the turn ("The psychic cannon did three wounds ... I rolled three sixes for the hand and the [UNIT:Archon]") [29:53–29:58].

- End Turn 3 scoring: Grey Knights picked up primary points and secondary objectives, but Drukhari maintained a large lead on primaries due to terraforming control [31:05–31:18].

---

# Turn 3

## [Drukhari] Turn 3 — Movement / Shooting / Charges / Fight

- Reserves: Drukhari still had reserves arriving — one deep-strike [UNIT:Venom] and one unit of [UNIT:Hellions] arrived from reserve at the end of Movement (dropped down) [32:51–32:59].

- **[UNIT:Scourge]** / Mandrakes shooting: Drukhari fired multiple units and "killed [UNIT:Castellan Crow]" — the narrator explicitly states "[I] did kill [UNIT:Castellan Crow] because I had a lot of stuff shooting [UNIT:Castellan Crow]. It was the mandates that took him out at the end" [33:17–33:28].

- Charges and fights: Drukhari charged with [UNIT:Archon] and [UNIT:Drazhar] into Grey Knight pockets; Archon jumped into combat and did multiple attacks — subsequently fighting Lady Malys and others in an extended melee [33:36–34:12].

- **[UNIT:Archon]** vs **[UNIT:Lady Malys]** [34:00–34:27]: Archon attacks hitting on threes, wounding on twos into Lady Malys — Lady Malys took three wounds (narration: "Wounding on twos into [UNIT:Lady Malys] ... She takes three wounds") [34:00–34:27]. Lady Malys then used a 5+ Feel No Pain (she made one of them) and was left with three wounds remaining [34:20–34:34].

- Fight resolution — [UNIT:Blade of the Dark Moon] and further exchanges: Additional fight details include a big clash where Lelith and others use their special weapons and tokens; the narrator details APs, lethal/sustained mechanics and outcome for particular combats, with Lady Malys surviving this round on her saves and pain token [34:54–35:25].

- End of Turn 3 scoring: Drukhari achieved [OBJECTIVE:Secure No Man's Land] and [OBJECTIVE:Cleanse] and collected objectives for a boost — narrator states "At the end of the turn, I will get my secure end and my cleanse ... we go on to a turn four" [35:25–35:30].

---

# Turn 4

## [Grey Knights] Turn 4 — Movement / Shooting / Charges / Fight

- CP/strat: Both players regained CP at start of turn four; Grey Knights picked up cards and Drukhari picked up Display of Might and Marked for Death for this round [36:02–36:08].

- **[UNIT:Grand Master]** (Grey Knights) [37:25–37:28]: A [UNIT:Grand Master] "popped off" and in that shooting phase killed a [UNIT:Venom] and one [UNIT:Cronos] ("that [UNIT:Grand Master] popped off and killed the [UNIT:Venom] and the [UNIT:Cronos]") [37:25–37:28].

- **[UNIT:Drazhar]** [37:58–38:26]: The Grey Knights charged Drazhar (or vice versa) and Drazhar ended up being killed by the Grand Master's hammer — narrator: "Three four ups on [UNIT:Drazhar] ... No, he's dead. He only has two wounds left ... the little mortal wound thing you did actually helped you kill him back then" [38:02–38:26]. (Confirmation of Drazhar's death at 38:20–38:26.)

- **[UNIT:Lady Malys]** [36:46–40:13]: Lady Malys was the focal point of multiple attacks across the turn; she took multiple rounds of mortal/devastating wounds and saved repeatedly with invulnerable saves and Feel No Pain tokens but was ultimately slain this turn: detailed sequence shows the back-and-forth with sustained hits, re-rolls and CP spending; final blow sequence ends with Lady Malys going down after a failed Feel No Pain and a final damage roll ("NO. She goes down ... [40:13]"). See the detailed clip of the final sequence where Grey Knights force invulnerable saves and fives for Feel No Pain, culminating in her death [39:56–40:13].

- End Turn 4 scoring: Grey Knights earned 5 points for Marked for Death and other adjustments; Drukhari continued to pick up primaries and secondaries as narrated [40:24–40:40].

---

## [Drukhari] Turn 4 → Turn 5 (final sequences, endgame)

- **[UNIT:Mandrakes]** / Pain Tokens usage [40:52–40:59]: Drukhari spent a Pain Token to "put my MANDRIX up in the sky" (used a token as part of positioning/airborne moves) — narrator: "this time though, I am going to spend one of my paint tokens to put my MANDRIX UP IN THE SKY" [40:52–40:59].

- Battleshock and points math: Drukhari recounts point totals and attempts to claim home objective but fails a Battleshock test, reducing the claimed total — "I'm up to max basically max ... I have to take a [UNIT:Battleshock] test ... I fail. So I don't actually get that. I only get an eight. So it's actually 38 points." This is Drukhari's numeric commentary on their final totals at this point [41:01–41:18].

- **[UNIT:Archon Scari]** + [STRATAGEM:Grenade] usage [41:47–43:05]: Archon Skari used a [STRATAGEM:Grenade] at least once (commentator notes a free grenade each turn carried massive value) and landed five dead wounds on a five-wound [UNIT:Dreadknight], killing it outright. "[I] shot that to death with a nice [UNIT:Dark Lance]. And then I just used my [STRATAGEM:Grenade] for free with [UNIT:Archon Scari] and rolled five dead wounds on a five wounded [UNIT:Dreadknight]. Bye-bye, [UNIT:Dreadknight]" [42:34–42:43].

- **[UNIT:Dreadknight]** (Grey Knights) death & explosion [42:41–42:47]: The Dreadknight died and the explosion dealt two mortal wounds to two nearby units (saying "Does he explode? The other one did. Does this one explode? Two for two. YES.") and that exchange killed one of [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors] — (Dreadknight explosion consequences narrated) [42:41–42:53].

- Scoring & timing of finish: After killing that Dreadknight and other successful plays, the Drukhari declared victory — "that [UNIT:Dreadknight] dies. It is game. And a dark Elar victory with a wellplaced free [STRATAGEM:Grenade]" [43:01–43:04]. The commentators confirm Drukhari wins and summarize that the Archon + Kabalite Warriors unit was MVP for doing massive damage and repeatedly using free grenades every turn [43:05–43:12].

---

# Final Results (end-of-video summary)

- Match outcome: Drukhari victory — declared directly at the moment the final Dreadknight died: "It is game. And a dark Elar victory with a wellplaced free [STRATAGEM:Grenade]" [43:01–43:04].

- Approximate final points (as narrated by the Drukhari player): Drukhari reports being "up to max" but after failing a Battleshock test "I only get an eight. So it's actually 38 points." — that narration of totals is given at [41:01–41:18]. (Note: the Gray Knights' final total is not stated as a single final number in the transcript; the Grey Knights had various secondary/primary tallies given at different points but a single final total for them is not explicitly declared in the provided transcript.)

- Units explicitly destroyed and the timestamps when the destruction was stated:
  - **[UNIT:Inceptor]** (one model) — killed by a Dark Lance shot from a [UNIT:Scourge] [9:21–9:23].
  - **[UNIT:Razorback]** — destroyed by [UNIT:Dark Lances] (Scourge) in Turn 1 shooting [9:23–9:27].
  - **[UNIT:Kalidus Assassin]** — declared dead ("Dead [UNIT:Kalidus]") after Drukhari shooting combo in Turn 1 [10:31–10:41].
  - **[UNIT:Purifier Squad]** (a full squad) — annihilated by [UNIT:Lady Malys] in a charge/fight (Turn 1) [11:16–11:26].
  - **[UNIT:Wyches]** (one unit) — destroyed by a Grey Knights [UNIT:Grand Master] using [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] in Turn 2 shooting ("...just nuked this unit of [UNIT:Wyches]. Absolutely destroyed them. Dead.") [15:01–15:04].
  - **[UNIT:Reaver Jetbike]** — survived a big volley with 1 wound in Turn 2 (not destroyed) but multiple Reaver/Jets involved in fights; explicit destruction of jets not clearly timestamped beyond survival commentary [15:13–15:18].
  - **[UNIT:Lelith Hesperax]** — killed by Grey Knights' devastating wounds in the Turn 2 fight after she inflicted many kills herself ("NO, you got her. She's dead.") [26:46–27:04].
  - **[UNIT:Incubi]** — entire Incubi unit(s) were killed by [UNIT:Castellan Crow] and Purifiers in Turn 3 ("[UNIT:Castellan Crow] and his two [UNIT:Purifier Squad] killed all the [UNIT:Incubi].") [30:17–30:21].
  - **[UNIT:Castellan Crow]** — killed by Drukhari shooting (Mandrakes + other fire) in Turn 3 ("I did kill [UNIT:Castellan Crow] ... it was the mandates that took him out at the end") [33:17–33:28].
  - **[UNIT:Drazhar]** — killed in Turn 4 combat by Grey Knights' Grand Master / hammer attacks (narrator: "No, he's dead. He only has two wounds left...") [38:02–38:26].
  - **[UNIT:Lady Malys]** — killed in Turn 4 after a long series of exchanges, failed Feel No Pain on the final blow and went down ("NO. She goes down." and commentary at [40:13]) [39:56–40:13].
  - **[UNIT:Dreadknight]** (one of Grey Knights' Dreadknights) — killed by Archon Skari’s grenade + Dark Lance combo / free grenade and exploded, causing collateral damage (declared at [42:34–42:45] and explosion described [42:41–42:47]).

- Units explicitly noted as surviving or MVPs at the end:
  - **[UNIT:Archon Scari]** + **[UNIT:Kabalite Warriors]** — called out as MVP and credited with major contributions throughout the game (grenades, sustained assaults, killing multiple key Grey Knight pieces) [33:30–33:36, 43:30–43:36]. The Drukhari endgame summary praises this unit's performance ("MVP ... that unit has done more damage by itself than most of the rest of my army") [43:30–43:36].
  - **[UNIT:Scourge]** units (with Dark Lances) — repeatedly used to remove Grey Knight armored threats (killing an [UNIT:Inceptor] and [UNIT:Razorback]) and provided heavy anti-vehicle value in multiple turns [9:21–9:27; 24:34–24:39].
  - Several Drukhari units (Wyches, Venoms, Reavers, Hellions, Mandrakes) are referenced throughout as being in play, deep-striking, or in reserves and contributing — the transcript repeatedly references these units as active and effective across many timestamps (multiple mentions, e.g., [3:35–3:46], [22:05–22:11], [32:51–32:59], [41:01–41:12]).

- Key turning points quoted with timestamps:
  - Dark Lances destroy the Grey Knights' [UNIT:Razorback] and kill an [UNIT:Inceptor] early, setting up tempo for Drukhari [9:21–9:27].
  - [UNIT:Lady Malys] charge annihilates a [UNIT:Purifier Squad] and then retreats into the [UNIT:Venom] using [UNIT:Wraithlike Retreat], swinging the early fight momentum to Drukhari [10:49–11:40].
  - [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax] executes a high-impact melee, killing a Purifier squad before being eliminated by Devastating Wounds — major trade executed in Turn 2 fight [26:02–27:04].
  - [UNIT:Archon Scari] + [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors] repeatedly use [STRATAGEM:Grenade] and sustained-assault to whittle down heavy Grey Knight targets — singled out in Turn 1 and again for MVP at endgame [9:38–10:10; 43:05–43:12].
  - The final sequence: [STRATAGEM:Grenade] + Dark Lance finishes a Grey Knight [UNIT:Dreadknight], its explosion causes collateral damage, and the Drukhari call game over with that play — "that [UNIT:Dreadknight] dies. It is game." [42:34–43:04].

Notes / clarifications (strictly quoted from the transcript)
- Every damage result, kill announcement, and key dice/stratagem commentary above is drawn from the narration and is cited inline by timestamp. If you would like an itemized list showing every single model casualty by name (e.g., "which Purifier models died in which minute"), I can extract each model-by-model casualty line-by-line from the transcript timestamps, but please note some model-level casualty granularities (e.g., "Purifier model #3 died at 25:42") are not always given in the commentary — the presenters more often report whole-unit kills or remaining wound counts.

If you want, I can:
- Produce a chronological, time-stamped roster of "unit-by-unit" fates (alive/dead and last seen timestamp) limited to the units explicitly mentioned as destroyed or surviving in the transcript.  
- Or make a condensed "turn-by-turn highlights" version focusing only on the biggest plays (e.g., Dark Lance Razorback kill, Lady Malys Purifier wipe, Archon Skari grenade that finished the Dreadknight). Which would you prefer?
