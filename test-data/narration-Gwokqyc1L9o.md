    - Ben "popped the venom, kill almost all of the Kabalite wars, kill the entire [UNIT:Scourge], kill all of the [UNIT:Rax]" earlier in Turn 2 summary; Turn 3 shooting then further focused on Talos and other targets with mixed results — multiple lines describe this across 17:45–18:07 and 27:07–27:24.
    - Later in Turn 3, [UNIT:Intercessor Squad] and [UNIT:Infiltrator Squad] fired on Scari's [UNIT:Archon]; Archon survived due to a smoke launcher/stratagem which saved him temporarily, then was later killed by Whirlwind salvo after failing Shadowfield [27:07–27:20][27:24–27:33].

    - [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist] failed to kill a [UNIT:Cronos] leaving one at one wound, and in turn the Cronos killed a wounded Terminator (Cronos used healing ability to restore wounds when it scored kills) [28:41–28:50].
  - Results summary for conversational phase: Scari notes Homunculus died and rematerialized via CP/pain tokens; Cronos survived to heal back up after killing a wounded terminator [28:36–28:50].

Ben had 20 shots but two of his models could not see; net result left the Talos endangered but not destroyed [37:56–38:07].
- Melee finishing sequence
  - Ben scored hits and damage on a final [UNIT:Talos] / warjack target: first crushing blow did 6 damage, second did 7 (combined effects leaving a model at 1 wound), then surge and charge into melee; final melee wiped out the target(s) resulting in Ben securing the final objective control [38:37–39:17].

  - Early Whirlwind barrage killing five Rax models and preventing immediate Homunculus post‑mortem disruption set the tempo in BR1 [10:26–10:45][10:51–10:58].
  - Scari's ability to resurrect Rax with Homunculus and use many pain tokens changed engagement dynamics midgame: "I bring back D3+1 ... three more Rax come back" [19:43–19:49].
  - Scari's haywire/Distillers of Fear play in BR3 produced Devastating Wounds and removed multiple high‑value models (including Scari claiming [UNIT:Bjorn the Fell-Handed] at [21:10–21:16]) and produced attrition on Ben's heavy hitters [21:47–23:12].
  - Ben's late BR4/BR5 recovery with Overwhelming Force, Behind Enemy Lines, and Recover Assets plus a decisive final surge/charge finishing off last Talos(s) swung the secondary score and ultimately produced the tied final score [34:57–35:03][37:26–37:33][38:37–39:17].
- Post-game notes:
  - Both players praised some units: Ben favored [UNIT:Inceptor Squad] (first time running them) and Scari reflected on Coven detachment strengths/weaknesses (lots of poison and big "gribblies") [39:53–40:09][40:12–40:33].

Final result: 74–74 tie, declared by players after Ben's final melee and objective captures [39:21–39:26].
