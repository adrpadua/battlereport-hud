[0:00] Hello and welcome to another Warhammer
[0:01] 40k battle report. Today, the Grey
[0:03] Knights versus the [FACTION:Drukhari]. Let's dive
[0:06] into the game.
[0:07] >> A dark king.
[0:10] >> Welcome to another match play battle
[0:12] report. We have the Warp Bane Task
[0:14] Force, [FACTION:Grey Knights], against [DETACHMENT:Skysplinter Assault]
[0:17] Assault [FACTION:Drukhari]. This is going to be a
[0:19] game of wits. Let's take a look at the
[0:21] armies. 2,000 points of sky splinter
[0:24] assault. And yes, I know there is not a
[0:26] [UNIT:Voidraven Bomber] bomber. I had to take it out
[0:28] to put in some more stuff. But this is
[0:30] the next iteration of my list. Let's
[0:33] take a look. I've got [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax]
[0:35] and two units of [UNIT:Wyches]. I've got
[0:37] [UNIT:Lady Malys] and a unit of [UNIT:Hand of the Archon].
[0:39] I've got [UNIT:Drazhar] and a unit of [UNIT:Incubi].
[0:42] That's right. We're going to try [UNIT:Drazhar]
[0:44] yet again. Once again, we've got [UNIT:Archon]
[0:46] Scar with the Nightmare Shroud and a
[0:48] unit of [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors]. And then a
[0:51] bunch of mission play stuff. Two units
[0:53] of five [UNIT:Harlequins]. And by harlequins,
[0:55] I mean [UNIT:Hellions]. Are you paying attention?
[0:58] I hope you are. One unit of [UNIT:Mandrakes],
[1:01] two units of three [UNIT:Reavers],
[1:03] four [UNIT:Venom] and one [UNIT:Raider] for dedicated
[1:06] transports, two single [UNIT:Cronos], and two
[1:09] units of a [UNIT:Scourge with Dark Lances]. And there
[1:13] you have it. 2,000 points on the nose.
[1:17] And here we have 2,000 points of grey
[1:20] knights using the warp bane task force.
[1:23] We've got Castling [UNIT:Castellan Crow] with his merry
[1:25] band of [UNIT:Purifier Squad]. 10 [UNIT:Purifier Squad] and four
[1:28] of them have incinerators. We got
[1:30] [UNIT:Librarian Zarek] by himself all by his
[1:32] lonesome. Got another five [UNIT:Purifier Squad]
[1:35] with a [UNIT:Techmarine] with a radiant
[1:37] champion enhancement. Another five
[1:39] [UNIT:Purifier Squad] to have some fun. We've got
[1:42] one squad of [UNIT:Strike Marines] over here. A
[1:44] [UNIT:Razorback] to protect the squishy
[1:46] insides. Three [UNIT:Grand Masters] in dread
[1:49] knight armor with two with uh
[1:51] sublimators. One that has an incinerator
[1:54] and the other two of side cannons.
[1:56] >> Very cool.
[1:56] >> We got some [UNIT:Inceptor Squad], [UNIT:Interceptors], a
[1:59] [UNIT:Kalidus Assassin], another squad of
[2:01] [UNIT:Strike Marines], and that takes us to
[2:03] 2,000 points on the money.
[2:04] >> There you have it. H lots of upy- downy,
[2:07] lots of shooty, lots of murder. Let's
[2:10] dive into the mission. Today we are
[2:12] playing mission O, Crucible Battle, and
[2:14] [UNIT:Terraforming Points] on Games Workshop layout
[2:16] number two. Of course, a huge shout out
[2:18] to all the companies that help with the
[2:20] bat repres. Of course, Frontline Gaming
[2:21] sent me the footprints. Mini Wargaming
[2:24] uh basically gave me a whole set of the
[2:26] runes of predition train. They're all
[2:27] magnetized, which is really cool. So, I
[2:29] can actually like make whichever L's I
[2:30] want at any point in time, which is
[2:33] really awesome. And uh of course, table
[2:35] war for the mat. Well, let's roll for
[2:38] attacker defender.
[2:39] >> All right.
[2:39] >> Ah, I rolled a four.
[2:41] >> I rolled six.
[2:41] >> Would you like to attack or defend?
[2:44] >> Dun dun.
[2:45] >> I think I'll defend.
[2:46] >> Okay. You want to deploy first cuz you
[2:49] uh want to do that. With that, you'll
[2:50] get the green for defender. I'll be red
[2:52] for attacker on our little scoreboard.
[2:54] And we'll come back after deployment.
[2:56] And here we are after deployment. So,
[2:59] uh, we went back and forth. I've already
[3:00] done my redeploys. We haven't rolled to
[3:02] see who goes first, but I put a cronis
[3:04] on the line. I've got five [UNIT:Wyches] in
[3:06] the [UNIT:Venom] [UNIT:Lady Malys] and half of the hand of
[3:09] the [UNIT:Archon]. I have a unit of [UNIT:Scourge]
[3:11] back here with [UNIT:Dark Lances]. The
[3:13] [UNIT:Mandrakes] helping me scream cuz this
[3:15] detachment has 6-in deep striking. The
[3:18] nose of this [UNIT:Raider] is on the objective
[3:20] because I have a unit of cabites. They
[3:21] can stick you the objective from inside
[3:22] of the [UNIT:Raider] which is kind of cool. And
[3:24] then of course the [UNIT:Reavers] ready
[3:26] to kind of go in any direction I need
[3:28] cuz we're playing [UNIT:Terraforming Points]. So I need
[3:29] to make sure you can get onto objectives
[3:31] and put [UNIT:Terraforming Points] up. And it's really
[3:32] going to be a back and forth resource
[3:34] management type of game. The [UNIT:Incubi] are
[3:37] on the floor with [UNIT:Drazhar]. And then we
[3:40] have another [UNIT:Cronos]. We have a [UNIT:Venom]
[3:43] with the second half of the hand of the
[3:45] [UNIT:Archon]. That's going to be really fun as
[3:46] well. And then of course my [UNIT:Archon]
[3:48] themselves with [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors] because
[3:50] of course all the [UNIT:Dreadknights] are back
[3:52] there. So it's not really a threat to
[3:55] any of my transports out in the open at
[3:57] all. I have put five [UNIT:Hellions] back here
[3:59] and another five [UNIT:Scourge] back there. In
[4:02] reserve I am deep striking a unit of
[4:04] [UNIT:Wyches] and a [UNIT:Venom]. Deep striking a
[4:06] unit of [UNIT:Hellions]. Strategic reserving
[4:08] [UNIT:Reavers] cuz I like having a
[4:10] unit in my back pocket. and five
[4:12] [UNIT:Wyches], just basic [UNIT:Wyches] on foot that
[4:15] are also in strategic reserve. Gives me
[4:16] some tools for later in the game. Forces
[4:18] the [FACTION:Grey Knights] to also screen out the
[4:20] board to stop me from just taking up a
[4:22] bunch of space. The [UNIT:Kalidus Assassin]
[4:25] infiltrated up here. Then we have the
[4:27] librarian by themselves just kind of
[4:28] hanging out there in a precarious
[4:30] position, but sometimes being aggressive
[4:32] is good. Then we have a unit of scouting
[4:35] [UNIT:Strike Squad] that are back here. We have a
[4:36] unit scouting. Uh, not scouting. We got
[4:38] [UNIT:Purifier Squad] and [UNIT:Interceptors] back here
[4:40] with the [UNIT:Techmarine] with the cool I do
[4:43] a bunch of mortal wounds after I attack
[4:45] you gun. I mean combat weapon. We've got
[4:48] [UNIT:Castellan Crow] and his [UNIT:Purifier Squad] back here. Unit
[4:50] of scouting [UNIT:Strike Squad] over here to go and
[4:51] sticky that objective. [UNIT:Purifier Squad] in this
[4:54] razorback. And then two of the grand
[4:56] masters. Of course, that one is OC7
[4:59] thanks to his enhancement. And that one
[5:00] does have a mace by the way. So, it is
[5:02] Wizzywig aka precision and anti-
[5:05] character two plus. Very good against
[5:07] knights, I would think. Um, okay. So,
[5:09] with that, in reserve, they uh grey
[5:12] knights have one [UNIT:Grand Master], dread
[5:14] knight. And with that, THE STAGE IS SET.
[5:17] LET US KNOW IN THE COMMENTS DOWN below
[5:19] who do you think will go and tell me how
[5:21] much you love or hate layout number two.
[5:23] As you can tell, very big open board.
[5:26] Um, aka everything can shoot everything,
[5:28] but that goes both ways.
[5:31] Turn one. Let's see. Are you ready, sir?
[5:33] >> Yes, sir.
[5:35] >> I rolled a three.
[5:36] >> I rolled a six.
[5:36] >> You got to go first. You have some
[5:38] [UNIT:Scout Squad]. Then I have some [UNIT:Scout Squad]. And it
[5:40] is game on. End of the [UNIT:Scout Squad]. We had
[5:44] one unit of [UNIT:Strike Squad] go behind that wall.
[5:46] And then one unit scout onto the
[5:47] objective. I had [UNIT:Lady Malys] scout into the
[5:49] little pocket. This is a very important
[5:52] part of layout 2 is that little pocket
[5:54] right there. And then I stayed 23 in
[5:56] away from that librarian with my scout
[5:58] momentum because I did not want to get
[6:00] in range of his crazy mind bullets. And
[6:03] I picked this objective for [UNIT:Lady Malys]'s
[6:05] [UNIT:Hand of the Archon] for extra OC and the
[6:07] um uh invulnerable save. So with that
[6:11] turn one, let's go to the cards AND ALL
[6:12] THAT GOOD STUFF. But enjoy the battle
[6:13] report and it's going to be lots of
[6:15] learning and fun times. Round number
[6:17] one, we each get a command point. And of
[6:20] course, we have recover assets and bring
[6:22] it down for the [FACTION:Grey Knights]. End of
[6:25] turn one. Why? Because that was it.
[6:27] There was not really any shooting. It
[6:29] was all about movement. We had [UNIT:Castellan Crow]
[6:30] advance up. We had [UNIT:Strike Squad] kind of move
[6:32] into that little building there and stay
[6:33] there. We had this [UNIT:Inceptor] unit move up
[6:35] and [UNIT:Terraforming Points] this objective. This
[6:37] objective is now sticky. The [UNIT:Razorback]
[6:39] has advanced forward. The Librarian and
[6:41] the [UNIT:Kalidus] are move forward. recover
[6:43] assets with the Calus and a unit of
[6:46] [UNIT:Strike Squad] in the back. The [UNIT:Dreadknights]
[6:47] are staying safe. The librarian uh the
[6:49] [UNIT:Techmarine] and [UNIT:Purifier Squad] are staying
[6:51] safe because they're the big damage
[6:52] dealers of the army. And with that,
[6:54] let's go to the scoreboard. So, uh
[6:56] you've got recover assets for three
[6:58] points. That's of course primary here,
[7:01] secondary here, and our battle ready
[7:03] points here. That'll give you three. And
[7:04] what are you doing with [OBJECTIVE:Bring It Down]?
[7:06] >> Getting rid of it.
[7:07] >> Getting rid of it for a command point.
[7:10] That's right. Lots of command points.
[7:11] Good to have. And with that, we go into
[7:13] my turn. Well, well, well. What are the
[7:16] odds? I get a command point. You get a
[7:17] command point. You're up to three. I'm
[7:19] up to two. And I got the exact same
[7:22] cards. I swear. I swear I shuffled this
[7:24] deck. Uh, recover. [OBJECTIVE:Bring It Down]. Well,
[7:27] um, that rhino, that [UNIT:Razorback] is
[7:30] awfully enticing for [OBJECTIVE:Bring It Down]
[7:33] points. But let's, uh, get to it. I'm
[7:36] looking forward to it. It's going to be
[7:37] a lot of murder. We're going to make the
[7:39] [UNIT:Raider] sticky this objective with the
[7:41] [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors]. That's the only thing
[7:43] I get. I get a [UNIT:Pain Token]. And then my
[7:46] strategy here is going to be to try and
[7:48] kill the callous assassin, potentially
[7:50] the librarian, and uh to basically flip
[7:52] the subjective and try and kill this
[7:54] unit over here as well. So, let's see if
[7:56] we can do it. End of the movement phase.
[7:58] Um, easy peasy. This unit of [UNIT:Wyches] got
[8:00] out. You decided not to spend 2 [UNIT:Command Point] on a
[8:02] watch with stormbbolters. You don't have
[8:04] any flamers there. So, uh, these [UNIT:Wyches]
[8:06] are essentially going to counter
[8:07] [UNIT:Terraforming Points].
[8:09] Uh, [UNIT:Lady Malys] is over here ready to
[8:11] basically put a charge in or go do some
[8:14] damage there. Uh, we'll see. We'll see
[8:16] about doing that charge. I don't know.
[8:19] It'll be definitely interesting. I
[8:20] forgot I'm playing [DETACHMENT:Skysplinter Assault].
[8:22] This [UNIT:Venom] has to go there. So, then uh
[8:24] [UNIT:Lady Malys] can go potentially charge here,
[8:26] kill, and then hop back into the [UNIT:Venom]
[8:27] with a [UNIT:Wraithlike Retreat]. That's the
[8:29] whole idea there. Um, I did screen out.
[8:32] They're going to probably [UNIT:Terraforming Points] in
[8:33] the middle with the [UNIT:Reavers], but
[8:34] I needed to stop the Deep Strikers. So,
[8:36] essentially, I've pushed out Deep
[8:37] Strikers and kept a lot of my damage
[8:39] dealersh. So, I've got [UNIT:Drazhar] [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax]
[8:42] back here with five [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors], an empty
[8:44] [UNIT:Venom] to potentially pick up [UNIT:Drazhar] if
[8:46] needed. This is an empty [UNIT:Venom]. The
[8:48] [UNIT:Archon], they moved up, disembarked. They
[8:50] cannot be overwatched. And I've got
[8:52] grenades and guns ready to try and get
[8:54] my [OBJECTIVE:Bring It Down] and or kill the
[8:56] [UNIT:Kalidus]. I will go out of my way to try
[8:58] to kill the [UNIT:Caladius Grav Tank]. do know this. Dark
[9:00] lances to try to kill a little
[9:02] [UNIT:Razorback]. [UNIT:Dark Lances] to potentially
[9:04] kill a [UNIT:Razorback] and potentially shoot
[9:06] at the [UNIT:Inceptor Squad] just in case the
[9:08] Razback dies quickly.
[9:10] Okay, so we have some we I have my
[9:13] shooting of course. You know, it is one
[9:16] of the most open tables in the bo in the
[9:18] game itself. Uh let's do some shooting.
[9:21] End of the shooting phase. I killed one
[9:23] [UNIT:Inceptor] with a [UNIT:Dark Lance]. I did kill
[9:25] the Razback with this unit of [UNIT:Dark Lance]
[9:27] [UNIT:Scourge], even though that unit of
[9:29] [UNIT:Dark Lance] [UNIT:Scourge] couldn't shoot
[9:31] anything through smoke. However, the
[9:34] MVPs of this turn were [UNIT:Archon Scari] and
[9:38] my little unit of [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors] who hopped
[9:41] out, grenaded the [UNIT:Caladius Grav Tank] to death,
[9:43] doing five [UNIT:Devastating Wounds], and then used the
[9:46] [UNIT:Sustained Assault] with four rerolls to
[9:49] hit to do just so much damage on the
[9:53] librarian. They did three hits with this
[9:55] the little blast pistol, three hits with
[9:57] the blaster, and then the ignore cover
[9:59] darks took seven wounds off of the racer
[10:03] pack. This unit already paid for itself
[10:05] tenfold. And then the [UNIT:Dark Lances]
[10:08] finished off the last three wounds
[10:10] finally. Uh, however, you didn't lose
[10:11] anything here. This [UNIT:Venom] did have a
[10:13] bead on the [UNIT:Purifier Squad], but didn't
[10:15] actually kill anyone cuz you're in
[10:16] cover. Very hard to kill you. However, I
[10:18] did [UNIT:Terraforming Points] that objective. this
[10:20] objective with the [UNIT:Hand of the Archon]
[10:22] half and this objective with the
[10:23] [UNIT:Wyches]. Actually not bad for a first
[10:26] turn. I have three [UNIT:Pain Tokens] in the
[10:27] bank. I was able to kill uh you know
[10:30] transport which is important. The
[10:31] librarian which is super important and
[10:33] the [UNIT:Kalidus] which is even more important
[10:35] cuz you know put it in chat. Dead
[10:39] [UNIT:Kalidus] equals good [UNIT:Kalidus]. Yeah dead
[10:41] [UNIT:Kalidus].
[10:44] The only good [UNIT:Kalidus] is a dead [UNIT:Kalidus].
[10:47] Uh let's go into the charge phase.
[10:49] [UNIT:Lady Malys] needs a seven to try to get into
[10:51] that. I only have one [UNIT:Command Point] though, so I
[10:54] can't afford to roll it, sadly. So,
[10:57] she's going to make it. Yeah, that's
[11:00] right. And on a good roll, too, cuz if I
[11:02] go too high, she has to go too far,
[11:04] which means I'm going to be able to
[11:05] fight, consolidate to the circle, and
[11:07] then use [UNIT:Wraith Retreat] with a [UNIT:Command Point] to get
[11:10] back into the [UNIT:Venom]. Nice. That skylppa
[11:13] at full boore, friends. End of the
[11:16] charge phase. [UNIT:Lady Malys] just and her little
[11:19] [UNIT:Hand of the Archon] absolutely
[11:20] annihilated that unit. She got three
[11:22] sustains and three [UNIT:Devastating Wounds] which
[11:24] meant three lethals. She just killed the
[11:26] whole unit. It was awesome. [UNIT:Lady Malys] did
[11:28] not suffer any wounds with that. The
[11:31] [UNIT:Archon] at the end of the fight phase is
[11:32] going to pile in is jumping into that
[11:34] [UNIT:Venom] as well. [UNIT:Lady Malys] used wraithlike
[11:36] retreat uh after they consolidated to
[11:38] move seven in and get back into the
[11:40] [UNIT:Venom]. So she has embarked back into the
[11:42] [UNIT:Venom] nice and safe. And uh you get to
[11:45] pick three units potentially to go into
[11:47] deep strike. Which ones are you going to
[11:49] pick with your great knight?
[11:50] [UNIT:Grand Master].
[11:51] >> [UNIT:Grand Master].
[11:52] >> [UNIT:Strike Marines]. Right back.
[11:53] >> Okay, so they're going to go off the
[11:54] board. Let's go to the scoreboard. So
[11:56] recover assets. We had [UNIT:Drazhar] and the
[11:58] [UNIT:Mandrakes] do recover assets for three
[11:59] points. And then [OBJECTIVE:Bring It Down]. That
[12:01] gives me a nice sevenpoint
[12:04] p secondary turn there. Not terrible.
[12:07] And with that, we go into the second
[12:09] turn. We'll draw your cards. You will
[12:11] get an extra [UNIT:Command Point]. You're up to three.
[12:12] You've been very judicious with your [UNIT:Command Point]
[12:15] use here. Uh, defend stronghold and kill
[12:18] stuff, which is definitely a good thing
[12:19] for uh, no prisoners, just kill things
[12:22] for get points. Considering I have a lot
[12:24] of small units, that's a pretty easy
[12:26] card to get against [FACTION:Drukhari]. Um, it is
[12:29] terraformed, so you do hold that
[12:31] objective for four points and no
[12:34] [UNIT:Terraforming Points]. I have terraformed all three
[12:35] of the objectives in No Man's Land,
[12:37] though, which is a huge boon to the
[12:38] Dukari. forces the uh the uh grey
[12:42] knights. I was going to say dark angels
[12:44] for some reason.
[12:47] I don't know. They look like dark angels
[12:49] to me. Whatever. They're just monkey.
[12:52] Monkey.
[12:54] >> Yeah. Or or monkey. Armored monkeys.
[12:57] >> Armored monkeys.
[12:58] >> That's right. And here we are after the
[13:00] movement phase. You decide to be more
[13:03] reserved than I thought you would. But I
[13:05] did kill four units in the first turn,
[13:07] which means you're going to run out of
[13:09] resources if you don't play at least one
[13:11] turn a little bit more conservatively to
[13:13] try and kill stuff. So you've kind of
[13:14] moved stuff out to kill the rea jet
[13:16] bikes and to [UNIT:Terraforming Points] in the middle. Uh
[13:18] [UNIT:Purifier Squad] are in the middle. You advance
[13:21] them to just take up this space here. Um
[13:23] it's more of a big threat for later in
[13:25] the game, like turn three onwards. The
[13:27] two [UNIT:Dreadknights] have come back. You've
[13:29] got the flamer one on that side so that
[13:31] the [UNIT:Scourge] cannot get a bead on you
[13:33] without getting overwatched to death.
[13:35] And uh you also have like a [UNIT:Meltagun]
[13:37] into that um into that uh [UNIT:Venom] and a
[13:41] side cannon and stuff. And that's
[13:43] [UNIT:Grey Knight Purifier] unit. So of course you get the
[13:44] hallowed ground bonuses. Uh this one
[13:47] here can see that unit of [UNIT:Wyches] there.
[13:49] you decided not to get aggressive with
[13:51] your [UNIT:Techmarine] uh because that would
[13:54] mean that he would die next turn
[13:55] guaranteed which is definitely not
[13:57] something you want all the time
[14:00] >> [UNIT:Lady Malys]
[14:02] she's not scary at all I don't know what
[14:04] you're talking about mate okay so with
[14:06] that let's h dive into the shooting
[14:08] phase but it is one of those things
[14:10] where you know you've realized that my
[14:12] army does more damage than you might
[14:13] have thought
[14:15] which is
[14:16] >> well game
[14:18] so you've decided to be a bit more
[14:19] reserved to try and keep uh without
[14:22] overstating. Uh the only thing that you
[14:25] kind of wish you had is something that
[14:26] could get onto this objective just to
[14:28] kind of pull down my [UNIT:Terraforming Points] as well
[14:30] there. And you didn't want to give me a
[14:32] reactive move on that [UNIT:Venom] so that you
[14:34] could shoot the [UNIT:Venom] because not I
[14:35] would have hit the [UNIT:Venom] with the [UNIT:Archon]
[14:37] and uh been annoying. So with that,
[14:39] let's dive in to turn number two
[14:42] shooting. You're trying to get [OBJECTIVE:No Prisoners]
[14:44] and you're trying to defend. So, you've
[14:45] created a bubble to defend your
[14:46] stronghold and uh yeah, and then no
[14:49] prisoners. You've got one potential kill
[14:51] there, another potential kill there, and
[14:53] that [UNIT:Venom] over there for three kills as
[14:55] well. So, shooting phase. Shooting phase
[14:58] that uh [UNIT:Grand Master] used the [UNIT:Stratagem]
[15:01] to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] wound rolls of one and then
[15:03] just nuked this unit of [UNIT:Wyches].
[15:04] Absolutely destroyed them. Dead. No
[15:07] primary for me.
[15:09] However, in stark contrast, everyone,
[15:13] >> this one [UNIT:Reaver Jetbike] lived with one
[15:15] wound after that entire unit of
[15:17] [UNIT:Purifier Squad].
[15:18] >> Did what?
[15:20] >> Everything
[15:20] >> did nothing
[15:23] suckers.
[15:25] >> So, it was like a billion storm alter
[15:27] shots, re-rolling hits, re-rolling
[15:28] wounds. Uh, and then all the
[15:30] anti-infantry weapons as well. Lived
[15:32] with one wound.
[15:33] >> Yep.
[15:33] >> Good job. And then this dreadmaster,
[15:36] [UNIT:Dreadknight], couldn't see the bikes
[15:38] anymore, so it couldn't finish them off.
[15:39] You [UNIT:Terraforming Points] with this objective
[15:41] because you can't bleed points with
[15:42] [UNIT:Terraforming Points]. And you shot this [UNIT:Venom] and
[15:45] it lived with three wounds. That's
[15:48] right. The flame hit three wounds and
[15:49] the [UNIT:Meltagun] gun failed to hit once even
[15:52] with rerolls. And then failed to wound
[15:54] uh the one that it hit even with
[15:55] rerolls. So the [UNIT:Venom] lived. It lived.
[16:00] Anger.
[16:03] >> You have some charges though. Unless you
[16:05] don't want to charge.
[16:06] >> No, we have to charge. We have to
[16:07] charge.
[16:08] >> Okay.
[16:08] >> [UNIT:Purifier Squad].
[16:09] >> Roll it up.
[16:11] >> Will they make it? You have two [UNIT:Command Point] in
[16:12] the bank.
[16:12] >> I do.
[16:13] >> You do. You do. Oh, that's going to be a
[16:15] three. Are you going? The thing is, if
[16:18] he doesn't kill this bike, right, it's
[16:20] going to force him to [STRATAGEM:Fire Overwatch] the bike
[16:22] because the bike's going to go and take
[16:24] the home because that's uh defense
[16:27] stronghold. You of course screened. You
[16:29] didn't put anybody on the objective. Uh
[16:31] which is just really annoying. So that
[16:33] bike literally I spend a [UNIT:Command Point] to auto pass
[16:35] it and just fly it up and then force you
[16:37] to [STRATAGEM:Fire Overwatch] it which then frees up
[16:39] these [UNIT:Scourge] to then shoot your dead
[16:40] [UNIT:Grand Masters]. So this thing living is
[16:43] like the most annoying thing this whole
[16:46] turn. It's crazy how like a little thing
[16:48] like that can just change the tone of
[16:50] the game or plans just in general.
[16:52] >> Yep. Yep. Yep. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Okay. I
[16:56] guess another option would have been to
[16:57] [STRATAGEM:Grenade] before you shot. So you could
[16:59] have [STRATAGEM:Grenade]
[16:59] >> while they're doing an action.
[17:00] >> No. Well, cuz it's before they do the
[17:02] action. So you could have grenaded and
[17:04] then done some wounds and then declared
[17:06] an action after that.
[17:07] >> But I didn't know if we could.
[17:08] >> Yeah, you can absolutely [STRATAGEM:Grenade] before
[17:10] that.
[17:10] >> Okay. Oh well, now we know.
[17:12] >> Now you know. Okay.
[17:13] >> You learn.
[17:14] >> Rroll charge is for for everybody
[17:16] watching at home. That is a four. I
[17:19] think I think that fails. I think
[17:22] >> it fails.
[17:22] >> I think that fails.
[17:23] >> I needed to double that. So that's four.
[17:25] >> Yeah. Okay. And you needed not a four.
[17:27] So, what's that [UNIT:Dreadknight] dram?
[17:35] >> Uh, it has to be nine cuz you can't
[17:37] >> be nine. Has to be nine. Yeah, it had to
[17:38] be nine.
[17:39] >> It's a 9 in charge. Are you going to go
[17:40] into the jet bike?
[17:44] >> And I'm demonetized now. So much
[17:46] swearing.
[17:46] >> So sorry. I'm so sorry.
[17:47] >> Okay, we had to give you a couple
[17:49] minutes to cool off. You almost flipped
[17:51] the table. There was so much anger.
[17:54] Just take over.
[17:57] >> Um Oh, I'm not GOING TO CHARGE. I I'm
[18:00] not charging.
[18:01] >> You don't want to just throw your
[18:02] >> No, I can't. I can't do it. I can't. I
[18:06] do that. These guys walk out and just
[18:08] bam, he's gone forever. Those guys walk
[18:10] out. He's gone for
[18:10] >> I've got [UNIT:Drazhar] right there. Just
[18:12] itching. Just itching, chomping at the
[18:14] bit. Chomping.
[18:16] >> So, with that, that's it. Final answer.
[18:18] >> Final answer.
[18:19] >> Okay, let's go on to the scoreboard. You
[18:22] got uh one kill for [OBJECTIVE:No Prisoners]. That's two
[18:25] points. That's uh not what I expected.
[18:27] And you're starting to finish normal.
[18:29] You up to five points there.
[18:30] >> Um you will get one [UNIT:Terraforming Points]. So you go
[18:32] up to five points. Awesome.
[18:34] >> And I do get two [UNIT:Terraforming Points].
[18:36] End of the turn. Two [UNIT:Terraforming Points].
[18:39] >> Good job. [UNIT:Terraforming Points].
[18:40] >> That hurt.
[18:41] >> That Yeah, that was not what I expected.
[18:43] I did not expect that at all.
[18:45] >> Full [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll], too. No,
[18:46] >> that's right. Nope. Nothing there.
[18:48] [UNIT:Purifier Squad] going to have to do some self
[18:50] purifying.
[18:51] >> Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. No other room.
[18:54] Yeah.
[18:54] >> Okay. So, with that, onto my turn. I'm
[18:57] gonna spend uh do I'm going to keep my
[18:59] [UNIT:Mandrakes] there. Whatever. My [UNIT:Mandrakes]
[19:01] are fine. You screened out, so there's
[19:02] no point in trying to bring them in or
[19:03] whatever.
[19:04] >> Um and then we'll go into my turn. Let's
[19:08] do this. Okay, let's do that. We've got
[19:11] uh 3 [UNIT:Command Point] to 2 [UNIT:Command Point]. Very nice. I do hold
[19:15] two objectives, so I will go up to 10
[19:17] points on primary. Very nice cuz I get
[19:21] eight points for holding two. You were
[19:22] able to stop me from holding the one.
[19:25] Um,
[19:25] >> it's better than I
[19:26] >> That's good. And then cards before I do
[19:28] any things. I've got assassination.
[19:31] Okay. I was going to try to kill that
[19:33] [UNIT:Techmarine] anyway. And display of
[19:35] might. You do have a free [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress]
[19:37] uh [UNIT:Grand Master] in strategic reserve. H I
[19:43] only have 2 [UNIT:Command Point]. Is it worth It's the
[19:45] thing is even it I h I need my 2 [UNIT:Command Point]. so
[19:49] much. So, I'm just going to roll it. I'm
[19:52] going to roll it, which does mean that
[19:53] if I don't pass it, it's fine. At least
[19:56] I've got a heat launch there.
[19:58] >> Are you going to
[20:00] not yet?
[20:01] >> Not yet. Are you going to see See,
[20:03] situational
[20:04] >> situational.
[20:05] >> We're talking about this. We were
[20:07] talking about this one [UNIT:Stratagem] that they
[20:08] have, which is like if you end within
[20:10] nine or whatever
[20:11] >> and six within six.
[20:13] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you start or end
[20:15] within six. So, it could actually do it
[20:17] to start. And then just blow him up. So
[20:19] you could actually blow him up before he
[20:21] even moves.
[20:22] >> Yes. And castle.
[20:23] >> See, it actually makes it's it actually
[20:25] came up. That's awesome.
[20:27] >> Okay. So I am going to roll it.
[20:29] >> Yes.
[20:30] >> Cuz this is [UNIT:Battleshock]. Need a seven.
[20:33] >> Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to force you to
[20:35] use it, baby. Let's go. So that's it. Uh
[20:39] start of the movement phase.
[20:40] >> I will use one [UNIT:Command Point] for [UNIT:Fires of the Coven]
[20:44] >> from this unit. I'm assuming.
[20:45] >> Yes. From that unit. And it's plus two
[20:47] to the roll. So, I need to roll four.
[20:48] >> Uh, yeah. So, as soon as Let's do that
[20:50] now. On a four up, you do D3 mortal
[20:52] wounds.
[20:53] >> Two, and then anything else that ends
[20:55] within six.
[20:56] >> Yes.
[20:56] >> For this move in phase, we'll get nuked
[20:58] as well. But he's going to start his
[21:00] movement here.
[21:01] >> So, on a two up,
[21:03] >> four up
[21:04] >> plus two
[21:05] >> cuz the [UNIT:Purifier Squad] or
[21:07] >> six added two to the result is you're
[21:09] holy within hologram, which they are.
[21:11] >> Okay. So, it's on a two plus.
[21:12] >> Oh, it is a two
[21:13] >> because it's plus two. It's a two plus.
[21:16] >> Yeah. D3 mortal wounds.
[21:19] >> Die.
[21:20] >> No, he's only had one wound. So
[21:22] >> I KNOW YOU OVER.
[21:24] >> YOU GOT HIM. That saves That saves your
[21:26] That's actually great use of his [UNIT:Command Point]
[21:28] right there. Star of the And I can't get
[21:31] Manalis out to go spend it. Okay, let's
[21:32] do some movement. You You saved your
[21:34] defense stronghold.
[21:36] >> I thought that was a waste.
[21:37] >> Yeah, it's great. Awesome. Good use of a
[21:39] strategm. Um, that's awesome. Uh for my
[21:42] uh [UNIT:Raider], I'm going to pick the 6-in
[21:44] disembark for the [UNIT:Wyches]. So, they're
[21:46] going to be able to disembark six
[21:48] inches. End of the movement phase. So, a
[21:50] lot of stuff happened. I decided to say,
[21:52] you know what? I am ahead of the game
[21:54] here in terms of points. So, because
[21:56] it's a practice game, I'm testing the
[21:58] limits of the list. I'm like, I'm just
[22:00] going to do get more aggressive than I
[22:02] feel I would need to get. Uh, sending
[22:05] [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax] with a six-inch disembark.
[22:07] Staying outside of six inches of the
[22:08] [UNIT:Grey Knight Purifier] so I don't take mortal wounds.
[22:11] Uh, [UNIT:Drazhar] moved out. So, essentially
[22:13] what I'm going to try to do is
[22:14] potentially charge into here with both
[22:16] units and then use a pile in. So, like a
[22:18] cascading combat where one unit can
[22:20] fight and kill a unit, then the second
[22:21] unit can pile in and fight a secondary
[22:23] unit that I did not declare as a target
[22:25] just to kind of stop interrupts and
[22:27] things like that from happening. As
[22:28] well, I sent these [UNIT:Hellions] up into the
[22:31] middle. This is here to pick up, say,
[22:35] uh, [UNIT:Drazhar]'s unit. If I decide not to
[22:37] charge with [UNIT:Drazhar], uh, the [UNIT:Raider] is
[22:38] here to pick up [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax]. Say I fight and
[22:40] then I want to run away with [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax], I
[22:42] can to get into the [UNIT:Raider], etc., etc.,
[22:45] etc. So, there's a whole variety of
[22:46] things that I can do there. Um, and then
[22:49] of course we have [UNIT:Lady Malys] that got out.
[22:51] This [UNIT:Venom] then followed her. I can hop
[22:53] back in or charge in. I'm trying to get
[22:54] assassinate. You [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress] this guy
[22:57] right here to heroically intervene
[22:58] threat for free. Used his [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress]
[23:01] there. My [UNIT:Archon] no [STRATAGEM:Fire Overwatch] nightmare
[23:04] shroud is over here with a [UNIT:Venom] ready
[23:06] to do some damage potentially try and do
[23:08] some work there. We've got [UNIT:Scourges]
[23:11] getting more aggressive to shoot dark
[23:12] losses downstream. Just taking up board
[23:14] space, right? That's the whole point
[23:15] here. I still have one [UNIT:Venom] in reserve,
[23:18] deep strike, and one unit of heliums in
[23:19] deep strike reserve. I brought in this
[23:22] unit of [UNIT:Wyches] in the back here, ready
[23:24] to kind of help screen these [UNIT:Mandrakes]
[23:26] moved up to screen out that 6-in uh deep
[23:29] strike that you can do with like your
[23:31] units, which is very annoying. Same with
[23:33] these [UNIT:Reavers]. They have a huge
[23:34] movement. So, put them back here if they
[23:36] can go to that objective or this
[23:37] objective relatively quickly to stop you
[23:39] from scoring primary. And of course,
[23:41] this [UNIT:Scourge] unit, nice little pocket
[23:42] right here, so you can pop out. They
[23:44] have one unit of [UNIT:Strike Squad] to shoot at,
[23:46] etc. So, with that, let's uh dive into
[23:48] the shooting phase. I've got four [UNIT:Pain]
[23:50] tokens to use. Let's see if I can make
[23:52] them count. Okay, mid shooting phase,
[23:54] TSN turning point. Killed a couple of
[23:56] [UNIT:Strike Squad] with some guns. Killed a couple
[23:57] of [UNIT:Purifier Squad] with some guns. Uh the free
[24:00] [STRATAGEM:Grenade] worth every penny. You did four
[24:02] damage on that [UNIT:Grand Master]. Two damage
[24:04] from a blast pistol. And then I have a
[24:07] [UNIT:Dark Lance] that you failed your save.
[24:08] You have seven wounds left on a five up.
[24:11] I just kill you with my [UNIT:Dark Lance]. So
[24:12] I'm going TO ROLL IT ON CAMERA. A four
[24:15] wounds. You're down to three wounds.
[24:20] Okay. And you decide not to uh [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] it
[24:23] there because you want a heroic over
[24:24] here. And it's going to cost you two
[24:26] with [UNIT:Lady Malys] nearby. So with that, we got
[24:28] some other guns. I just wanted to show
[24:30] off maybe killing a [UNIT:Dreadknight]. Didn't
[24:31] happen. Okay, fine, fine. End of the
[24:32] shooting phase. I was able to kill that
[24:34] unit of [UNIT:Purifier Squad], just barely with uh
[24:37] these [UNIT:Dark Lances]. They finally did some
[24:39] work. There's two of these folks left
[24:42] alive. And then, of course, uh got some
[24:44] charges. So, we got three wounds on that
[24:46] [UNIT:Grand Master]. We're going to try and
[24:48] charge that [UNIT:Archon] in because he moved
[24:50] out. So, we're going to try to do that.
[24:52] Uh he can't be overwatched, which is
[24:53] awesome. And then if he kills it, he can
[24:55] hop back into the [UNIT:Venom] and stay safe.
[24:57] DR the thing here is because this is why
[24:59] I didn't want to commit too many things
[25:01] because I can only use wraithlike
[25:02] retreat once and the [UNIT:Venom]'s back here.
[25:04] So I could do something like charge
[25:06] [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax] into here and then wraith like
[25:08] retreat but then you've got your big
[25:09] unit or I can charge him into here and
[25:12] then [UNIT:Wraithlike Retreat] with them and
[25:14] then [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax] just sacrifices yourself.
[25:16] But at least I do damage to the
[25:17] [UNIT:Grey Knight Purifier]. So there's a variety of things
[25:18] that I can do mid of the combat phase.
[25:21] This has been quite the combat phase so
[25:23] far. So I charge into this unit with
[25:25] both units. You I charged it here. you
[25:27] decide to hero intervene. [UNIT:Lady Malys] killed
[25:29] the techine and all the [UNIT:Purifier Squad]
[25:31] literally by herself. Like she just did
[25:33] another three sustained lethal hits. It
[25:36] was awesome. She's just absolutely
[25:38] crushing everything. I killed that uh
[25:41] guy with my [UNIT:Huskblade]. So, he's now
[25:43] souped up with the husbade. He gets plus
[25:44] one attack, plus one strength. So, he's
[25:46] up to six. He's basically got the same
[25:48] weapon as [UNIT:Lady Malys] now, except one less
[25:50] AP, which is cool. And then, uh the
[25:52] [UNIT:Incubi] killed that unit. And now [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax]
[25:56] has activated piled in and is going to
[25:58] fight the [UNIT:Purifier Squad] back here. And she
[26:00] is using her super turn thing. So let's
[26:02] see if I can do some damage. [UNIT:Pain] to
[26:04] give her plus one strength, plus one AP
[26:05] plus lance from getting out of a
[26:07] transport. Let's see if we can do some
[26:09] damage. But I cannot get line of sight
[26:11] on [UNIT:Castellan Crow]. I'd like to stab him to death
[26:13] as well with [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax]. That would be
[26:15] really good, but it's not going to
[26:16] happen today. Okay, end of well sort of
[26:19] the end of the fight phase. First of
[26:20] all, this hammer killed four of my core
[26:23] of the [UNIT:Archon]. I mean, hand of the
[26:24] [UNIT:Archon], not court, [UNIT:Hand of the Archon],
[26:26] but [UNIT:Lady Malys] is still alive and angry.
[26:29] Angry. Look at her. Anger. Um, then over
[26:33] here, you kill three with the two pure
[26:36] fires. Just two of them killed three
[26:37] [UNIT:Wyches]. And then [UNIT:Castellan Crow] got two dev
[26:39] wounds in and three saves. This is
[26:40] important because [UNIT:Lady Malys] is [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax] is
[26:42] behind a wall with a three bimin bolt,
[26:44] but the [UNIT:Devastating Wounds] go after the fights,
[26:46] which means I need to try and save. Put
[26:48] one dev wound on at least one of these
[26:50] to keep [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax] alive. So, three
[26:52] immunable saves. Will her blood brides
[26:55] keep [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax] alive,
[26:59] two die, and two devs GO ONTO [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax].
[27:04] >> YES, FOR THE EMPEROR.
[27:07] >> NO, you got her. She's dead. Sad face.
[27:12] Would you like to pile in anywhere?
[27:15] >> No.
[27:16] >> Good. Uh, I'm spending I'm spending my 1
[27:19] [UNIT:Command Point] to wraith like retreat. So, they're
[27:21] going to fall back or move and embark
[27:24] into said [UNIT:Raider] back here um with a
[27:27] [UNIT:Wraithlike Retreat] and then of course
[27:30] that unit is wholly within six of the
[27:31] [UNIT:Venom] and they're going to pop back in
[27:33] to said [UNIT:Venom] as well. And with that
[27:36] with [UNIT:Lelith Hesperax] died but she did look she
[27:38] killed literally the entire squad of
[27:40] [UNIT:Purifier Squad]
[27:43] just by herself. She did like 15 wounds
[27:45] like shank shank shank shank shank
[27:47] shank. It was great AP3 with a [UNIT:Pain]
[27:49] token. Very good. Uh, you didn't have
[27:52] any [UNIT:Command Point] for an invul save or anything.
[27:54] And uh, I'm dwindling the [FACTION:Grey Knights].
[27:56] You've got a couple of units left. And
[27:59] uh, do you want to pick up anything?
[28:00] >> And then my turn. I
[28:02] >> You're going to get your defense. That's
[28:04] no problem.
[28:04] >> I will.
[28:05] >> I will get my
[28:06] >> I'll pick these guys up back here.
[28:07] >> Yeah, these are going to stay. Well, he
[28:08] has to stay.
[28:09] >> He has to stay. And then he will stay
[28:10] because
[28:10] >> And the [UNIT:Purifier Squad] are staying as well.
[28:12] >> Yes.
[28:12] >> Okay. So, I will get [OBJECTIVE:Display of Might]
[28:14] for four points and a five point
[28:16] assassination. Nine points bring up to
[28:18] 16 in total.
[28:20] and I will get another three [UNIT:Terraforming Points]
[28:22] points. So, I go up to 13 [UNIT:Terraforming Points] and
[28:26] you will go up uh three points for
[28:29] defend to an eight. So, in two turns,
[28:31] we've had quite a crazy amount of
[28:34] action. Let's go into your turn number
[28:37] three. Woo, that was two turns.
[28:40] >> That's wild. So, I'll go back up to one
[28:42] [UNIT:Command Point]. You go up to one [UNIT:Command Point]. Let's see what
[28:45] your cards are. You've got your defend.
[28:47] That's no problem. Cards. We've got
[28:49] [OBJECTIVE:Extend Battle Lines]. Okay, not bad. And establish
[28:52] [UNIT:Locus of Power]. Press buttons, which you can
[28:54] always use as well. And then, of course,
[28:56] they're going to hide in a transport.
[28:58] >> End of the movement phase. Uh, you
[29:00] stayed in combat with [UNIT:Lady Malys]. You move
[29:02] this guy up. [UNIT:Castellan Crow]'s like, YOU KNOW WHAT?
[29:04] FOR GLORY, YOU TELL ME one of the cool
[29:08] stories. What is Castelin [UNIT:Castellan Crow] going to
[29:10] do? Is he going to be the best guy ever,
[29:12] or is he going to join Drago uh with all
[29:16] the warp dust? Oh,
[29:20] >> that's right. I'm power from [UNIT:Pain]. I'm
[29:23] making you remember you can't take Drago
[29:25] anymore. Then again, I don't feel sorry
[29:27] for you because I lost my [UNIT:Beastmaster]. I
[29:28] lost Uran. I lost [UNIT:Grotesques]. I lost the
[29:32] core of the [UNIT:Archon].
[29:33] >> I lost brother Stern.
[29:35] >> Yeah, that's a very stern message for
[29:36] all of you out there. So, I did wrap and
[29:38] ingress these aliens back here and you
[29:40] did bring them onto your home objective.
[29:42] You did get four points on primary
[29:44] though for that objective over there.
[29:45] bring you up to a grand total of nine on
[29:48] primary. And with that, let's dive into
[29:50] the turn. Hooray. The psychic cannon did
[29:53] three wounds into and I rolled three
[29:56] sixes for the hand and the [UNIT:Archon].
[29:58] Three. He's like, I WILL SAVE YOU, LADY
[30:01] [UNIT:Lady Malys]. I will save you.
[30:05] >> Oh god.
[30:07] >> You did kill the [UNIT:Raider] though with with
[30:09] the melt to get over here. You do have a
[30:10] melt into that [UNIT:Venom] though.
[30:12] >> Let's do the melt.
[30:12] >> Oh man, I just want to show that off.
[30:14] That's awesome. Yay. End of the shooting
[30:17] phase. [UNIT:Castellan Crow] and his two [UNIT:Purifier Squad] killed
[30:19] all the [UNIT:Incubi]. They imagine if that was
[30:21] a 10 strong unit. O and uh that's it.
[30:25] You kill this [UNIT:Venom] with the [UNIT:Meltagun]. You
[30:27] put that [UNIT:Venom] down to one single wound
[30:30] with a volley of storm bolt of fire from
[30:32] hallowed ground. And now we go into some
[30:34] charges. Okay. Okay. Into the charge
[30:36] phase. You kill little cap lights.
[30:37] [UNIT:Lady Malys] put four damage on this great
[30:40] dragon master. And you are hitting me.
[30:42] You got two wounds through. So, we're
[30:43] gonna SEE IF [UNIT:Dragon Master] CAN DO more
[30:45] sixes. Okay. Okay. Six. No, he does.
[30:50] >> And then [UNIT:Lady Malys] has a four up. She's
[30:52] okay. Oh, she owes you a hazardous as
[30:54] well. She's fine there, too.
[30:56] >> Yeah, there were the sixes. There was
[30:57] two sixes right there. But you killed
[30:59] him. He's dead, but [UNIT:Lady Malys] is still very
[31:01] much alive. Just continue to be
[31:03] annoying. So, let's go to the
[31:05] scoreboard. I will get three more
[31:06] [UNIT:Terraforming Points]. So, I'll go up to 16 points
[31:09] here. You will get a [OBJECTIVE:Extend Battle Lines] battle lines
[31:13] with [UNIT:Castellan Crow] which does give you a very
[31:15] fancy four points. Well, that will bring
[31:18] you up to a 12 on secondaries. Nicely
[31:20] done.
[31:21] >> And you will get rid of [UNIT:Locus of Power].
[31:24] >> You want to get an extra [UNIT:Command Point] there.
[31:27] >> That is a discard as you move on to
[31:29] [FACTION:Drukhari] turn number three. So, I do get
[31:32] a command point. Excellent. You get
[31:33] another command point. You're up to
[31:34] three, which will help offset [UNIT:Lady Malys] and
[31:37] her [UNIT:Lady Malys]. Malicely [UNIT:Lady Malys] goodness. So
[31:41] I will get another eight points on
[31:43] primary. Very nice. Two objectives over
[31:45] there. Bring me up to 24. So the points
[31:47] are just very in skew of the [FACTION:Drukhari]. Um
[31:50] right now we've got cleanse, which is
[31:52] doing actions in no man's land, and
[31:54] secure no man's land, which is being in
[31:56] no man's land. So I should be able to
[31:58] get those points. But I'm going to see
[32:00] if I can just finish this with a
[32:02] uppercut blow. Let's see if we can do
[32:04] all the damage. We're going all in and
[32:06] see. Just let me know down below if
[32:08] you've if you play [FACTION:Grey Knights] and how
[32:11] awesome it is that hammers hit on
[32:12] threes.
[32:13] >> Yay.
[32:17] >> Here I come to my torture chamber where
[32:19] I psychologically torture you about the
[32:21] rules of your
[32:23] >> end of the moon phase. Let's go. Just
[32:26] Oh, I have to move these [UNIT:Hellions].
[32:29] They're going to move something like
[32:30] this and like this so they can they can
[32:33] pick and choose who they want to go
[32:34] against. By the way, that little uh
[32:35] [UNIT:Mortal Wounds] did like three
[32:37] mortals to [UNIT:Drazhar], a mortal here, one
[32:39] mortal here, and basically stopped me
[32:41] from getting within 6 in with a lot of
[32:43] other stuff. So, I did not want it like
[32:45] them cuz I don't want to take more
[32:46] mortals through that silly strategm. And
[32:49] then my last reserve. That's right. I
[32:51] still had reserves. Drop down the [UNIT:Venom]
[32:53] and [UNIT:Wyches]. I taking out that void
[32:56] raven bomber from this list gave me so
[32:59] many more things which I'm definitely
[33:02] feeling the difference. I love my void
[33:04] raven bomber, but if you're trying to
[33:05] play competitively, you just need more
[33:07] stuff and that activation economy is so
[33:10] important. So, let's do some shooting.
[33:12] Let's see what we can do and then we'll
[33:13] come right back. Okay, so let's do the
[33:17] Well, he survived. Actually made a
[33:18] couple of involves and [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] the save
[33:20] to stay alive. So, you've got one at
[33:21] nine wounds, one at six wounds. They're
[33:22] still alive. I did kill [UNIT:Castellan Crow] because I
[33:25] had a lot of stuff shooting a [UNIT:Castellan Crow]. It
[33:27] was the mandates that took him out at
[33:28] the end. And then this unit has one guy
[33:31] left with one wound. So [UNIT:Archon Skari] is
[33:34] going to try and charge in there. So
[33:36] with that, let's do some charges. We're
[33:38] going to send [UNIT:Drazhar] in. Whatever. Aha.
[33:41] No, he's No, I don't have any [UNIT:Command Point], so
[33:45] that's fine. The [UNIT:Archon]'s going to jump
[33:46] in. Oh, look. There's There's [UNIT:Drazhar]'s
[33:49] charge right there. So [UNIT:Archon]'s going to
[33:52] jump into there and then we've got this
[33:54] fight over here and we're going to zoom
[33:56] into this fight after the [UNIT:Archon] has
[33:58] killed one. So you have five attacks
[34:00] hitting on threes, re-rolling ones,
[34:03] couple of twos again.
[34:04] >> Oh no.
[34:05] >> Wounding on twos into [UNIT:Lady Malys].
[34:09] Okay, that's three invulnerable saves. I
[34:12] have no [UNIT:Command Point]. Four ups. That's right.
[34:15] Intense. Intense.
[34:18] She takes three wounds. Oh. Oh no.
[34:20] >> [UNIT:D6] plus one.
[34:21] >> Okay, she has a five on feeling [UNIT:Pain]. So
[34:23] you better roll high.
[34:25] >> Oh five. Okay, she makes one of these.
[34:27] She lives.
[34:30] >> Live [UNIT:Lady Malys]. Yes, SHE TAKES TWO. BOSS.
[34:34] [UNIT:Lady Malys]. SHE IS SUCH A BOSS.
[34:39] She has three wounds remaining. Yes.
[34:43] Yes. Come here, my pretty. Now I could
[34:46] either do sustained or lethals. So,
[34:48] because you're a five up, I'm going to
[34:50] use the s the [UNIT:Pain Token] to give her
[34:52] lethal hits.
[34:54] >> Big fight with the [UNIT:Blade of the Dark Moon] on two.
[34:57] Sixes are lethal, one lethal. Oh no. And
[35:02] needing fives to wound, sixes are devs.
[35:04] Okay, so two saves at AP three. So, two
[35:08] imulse,
[35:08] >> four pinball,
[35:09] >> THREE DAMAGE EACH. OH, YOU'RE FINE. And
[35:12] does she take hazardous? She does not.
[35:14] Six attacks from her little fan. Well,
[35:17] lethal and sixes one. TAKE IT FROM THE
[35:21] FAN. LET'S GO FAN. AH, SAD. OKAY. WELL,
[35:25] that was fun. At the end of the turn, I
[35:27] will get my secure end and my cleanse.
[35:30] And we go on to a turn four. However, I
[35:34] do get three more points here for uh uh
[35:37] doing fun things. We go to turn four and
[35:40] I will get a five and a five. That's a
[35:43] big 10 point. You know, I think we could
[35:44] stop counting points, but we're gonna
[35:46] keep on going for all of you at home.
[35:48] And uh if you actually care about the
[35:51] channel, you're going to stick around
[35:52] until the end because we're going to
[35:53] talk about the game. That's right. And
[35:55] you're going to like and you're going to
[35:55] share and you're going to subscribe and
[35:57] uh you're going to check out the Patreon
[35:58] page so that I can keep on making more
[36:00] videos. That's right. So, you get a [UNIT:Command Point],
[36:02] I get a [UNIT:Command Point], and you're going to get
[36:05] [OBJECTIVE:Display of Might] and [OBJECTIVE:Marked for Death].
[36:08] And you don't owe me Oh, yeah. You owe
[36:09] me a battle shock on him.
[36:10] >> I do. I do.
[36:11] >> And you get zero primary. Oh, no. Yeah,
[36:13] cuz I I pulled a Aha. Pulled that down.
[36:16] >> You are fine. So, no arrow shock needed
[36:18] there.
[36:19] >> Uh, with that, you get to do some
[36:20] fights.
[36:21] >> Gamma target for my [OBJECTIVE:Marked for Death].
[36:23] >> Yeah, [UNIT:Drazhar]. Well, I'm going to mark
[36:25] those [UNIT:Wyches]. I'm going to mark those
[36:26] [UNIT:Scourge]. I'm going to mark uh
[36:29] >> that unit of [UNIT:Wyches] back there because
[36:31] you can't get to them. Sure. And uh
[36:34] we're going to do some fights. I was
[36:35] thinking I would just pick [UNIT:Lady Malys] just
[36:37] to make it interesting. You know what?
[36:39] Yeah, I'm going to pick [UNIT:Lady Malys].
[36:41] >> No.
[36:43] No,
[36:44] >> just for fun. Let's see if she can
[36:46] survive.
[36:46] >> Oh, look.
[36:48] >> Sorry, I forgot. I didn't show off the
[36:49] roll, but the psychic cannon did four
[36:51] wounds. I made four impulse saves for
[36:52] [UNIT:Lady Malys]. That's right. [UNIT:Lady Malys]. Just
[36:56] crushing it. Good job. Okay. Okay. Do
[36:58] the [UNIT:Meltagun]. Let's see. She's definitely
[37:00] just rubbing it in. So, one hit with the
[37:02] [UNIT:Meltagun]. Does it wound? Does it wound? It
[37:05] does. Four up for [UNIT:Lady Malys]. Oh, no. That's
[37:07] where my [UNIT:Command Point] goes. Four up FOR [UNIT:Lady Malys].
[37:10] YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
[37:13] She's still alive.
[37:18] >> She's still alive, baby. It's going to
[37:20] come down to the fight again.
[37:23] End of the shooting phase. That
[37:25] [UNIT:Grand Master] popped off and killed the
[37:27] [UNIT:Venom] and the [UNIT:Cronos] and is going to
[37:28] charge and kill Draar. Well, maybe kill
[37:30] [UNIT:Drazhar], but this was the one I cared
[37:32] about.
[37:33] >> Yeah, that's right. Charging him. Okay.
[37:37] And we've got a couple of charges to
[37:38] show. Oh, that's a long charge. Well
[37:40] done. You could have gone anywhere you
[37:41] wanted to.
[37:42] >> Yeah,
[37:43] >> it doesn't matter though.
[37:44] >> Just pop on.
[37:45] >> Don't want to get within uh Oh, I don't
[37:47] have any [UNIT:Command Point], so it doesn't matter.
[37:48] >> I can't heroic in vain or anything.
[37:50] You're on the objective. You're 70 OC
[37:52] right there cuz you have an an
[37:53] enhancement and everything. Cool.
[37:54] >> I can't.
[37:55] >> Let's see if [UNIT:Drazhar] survives this.
[37:58] >> Threes rolling.
[37:59] >> Big hammer.
[38:00] >> Uh re-rolling cuz I'm a character. Oh,
[38:02] no. Cuz
[38:02] >> rolling ones.
[38:03] >> Yeah, you hit all the time.
[38:05] >> Cool. Twos. Uh, [UNIT:Drazhar] is gonna have to
[38:08] take three involve saves.
[38:10] >> Three four ups on [UNIT:Drazhar]. Are you ready?
[38:16] >> Oh, you got him.
[38:19] >> [UNIT:D6] plus one.
[38:20] >> No, he's dead. He's dead. He only has
[38:21] two wounds left. The little mortal wound
[38:23] thing you did actually helped you kill
[38:25] him back then.
[38:26] >> Yes.
[38:26] >> And now we go to the one we're all
[38:28] waiting for. [UNIT:Pain Token]. You know what?
[38:31] I'm going to go for [UNIT:Sustained Hits] this
[38:32] time cuz I want to get uh I want to get
[38:35] Yeah. Yeah. Just sustain. You know what?
[38:37] >> Who cares? I'm going to roll [UNIT:Devastating Wounds]
[38:39] to kill you anyway.
[38:40] >> Yeah.
[38:40] >> So, it's all or nothing. Better get lots
[38:42] of attacks. Hitting on twos.
[38:45] >> Oh, no.
[38:48] >> Yeah. You're so happy.
[38:50] >> I love it. Sixes. Well, fives, but sixes
[38:53] just kill you. Trip sixes means I don't
[38:55] have to worry about it anymore. Oh, one.
[38:58] Three [UNIT:Devastating Wounds]. You go down to six.
[39:00] Does that bracket you or do you bracket
[39:01] it five? Four.
[39:03] >> Five or four.
[39:04] >> Oh, well, that's a that's a shame.
[39:05] [UNIT:Lady Malys] has to survive. Oh. Uh, she's not
[39:08] doesn't take any crazy stuff. And then
[39:10] we'll do her little fan. See, look.

[39:15] fan does one. Come on. Come on. COME ON.
[39:17] COME ON. YES, SHE DOES ONE.
[39:21] >> Does that bracket you now?
[39:22] >> No. Down to four.
[39:23] >> A boo.
[39:25] >> Oh.
[39:26] >> H. I love it. Okay. Needing threes.
[39:29] We're rolling once. Uh. Oh, that's a
[39:31] two. Got one. [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll]. Oh. needing twos.
[39:35] Come on, [UNIT:Lady Malys]. You got this.
[39:37] >> She's a boss. Let's go. Two ones. Two
[39:41] twos.
[39:42] >> Do you want to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll]? Use your free and
[39:44] a one to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] one. Yes, absolutely.
[39:46] Yep. That's three. You use your free
[39:48] [UNIT:Stratagem]. Three invulnerable saves.
[39:51] >> Come on, baby.
[39:52] >> Let's go, [UNIT:Lady Malys]. Let's go.
[39:56] >> One. One goes through. [UNIT:D6] damage plus
[39:59] one.
[40:00] >> Oh, nos here. How many? HOW MANY? FIVE.
[40:03] I GOT [UNIT:Feel No Pain]. DON'T YOU
[40:05] CELEBRATE. Don't you celebrate.
[40:08] Fives.
[40:10] NO.
[40:13] >> NO. She goes down. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No.
[40:20] And that is the end of the turn. Let's
[40:22] go to the scoreboard. Okay. So, you get
[40:24] five points for Mark for death. Boo. Are
[40:27] you getting rid of uh [OBJECTIVE:Display of Might]?
[40:29] Okay. So, you up to se Mark for death is
[40:31] five points. 17 there. Nicely done.
[40:34] Display might you get a command point
[40:36] and I will get another three points on
[40:40] [UNIT:Terraforming Points]. You know, missionwise.
[40:45] >> That's still my [UNIT:Terraforming Points]. I don't know
[40:46] what you're talking about. I know what
[40:48] you're talking about. I love this
[40:49] mission. This mission is fair and
[40:50] balanced.
[40:51] >> Yeah.
[40:52] >> Uh this time though, I am going to spend
[40:54] one of my paint tokens to put my MANDRIX
[40:56] UP IN THE SKY. OKAY. SO, I will get 12
[40:59] cuz I hold your home objective now. Heck
[41:01] yeah.
[41:01] >> Oh no.
[41:02] >> I'm up to max basically max. That's
[41:05] that's max right there.
[41:06] >> And behind enemy lines.
[41:07] >> Uh and no prisoners. Actually, I don't
[41:10] necessarily hold your home because I
[41:12] have to take a [UNIT:Battleshock] test. So I'm
[41:14] going to take a [UNIT:Battleshock] test on a
[41:15] seven. And I fail. So I don't actually
[41:18] get that. I only get an eight. So it's
[41:20] actually 38 points. You know what?
[41:22] Whatever. Fine. You know, be that way.
[41:24] It is what it is.
[41:27] Uh behind enemy lines. Not that I have
[41:28] anybody behind enemy lines. No
[41:30] prisoners. I only have two things to
[41:31] kill. Let's do this. End of the movement
[41:33] phase. We did a bunch of movement. Uh
[41:35] let's see if we can kill some dread
[41:36] knights. I used the the [UNIT:Reavers].
[41:39] Got a [UNIT:Pain Token] super ability. Um
[41:41] that's the one that I got for the turn.
[41:43] Basically went for that one. Uh [UNIT:Archon]
[41:45] Scari. The [UNIT:Venom] moved up. They got out
[41:47] and I use the [UNIT:Stratagem] to be able to
[41:49] charge after they got out. So I'm going
[41:51] to be able to potentially shoot and or
[41:52] charge. And we've got some grenades set
[41:54] up and stuff. Let's just jump. Oh no.
[41:56] I've got a free [STRATAGEM:Grenade] here basically.
[41:57] Yeah. So, we'll uh do some shooting and
[42:00] see if we can kill him. So, I double
[42:01] checked the ruling. The [UNIT:Archon] can take
[42:03] [UNIT:Battleshock] away from vehicles and
[42:05] stuff, which actually helps with my
[42:06] behind enemy lines. So, I'm going to
[42:07] just shuffle that a bit, keep the [UNIT:Venom]
[42:09] behind enemy lines, strip take away the
[42:11] [UNIT:Battleshock], so he counts for behind
[42:12] enemy lines, which allows me to save a
[42:13] [UNIT:Pain Token] to then just bring the bikes
[42:15] to contest this objective regardless of
[42:17] what happens. Um, and I'm going to
[42:19] [UNIT:Terraforming Points] that objective because I'm
[42:21] cruel. Terraformed. You can't take that
[42:24] away.
[42:27] That one's one you can't [UNIT:Terraforming Points] back,
[42:29] baby. Uh, that's right. Okay, let's do
[42:32] some shooting now. Okay, I shot that to
[42:34] death with a nice [UNIT:Dark Lance]. And then I
[42:36] just used my [STRATAGEM:Grenade] for free with
[42:38] [UNIT:Archon Scari] and rolled five dead wounds
[42:41] on a five wounded [UNIT:Dreadknight]. Bye-bye,
[42:43] [UNIT:Dreadknight]. Does he explode? The other
[42:45] one did. Does this one explode? Two for
[42:47] two. YES.
[42:50] AND he's going to do some damage to
[42:51] Argon Scari in return. And he kills one
[42:53] of his [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors]. Boo. And with that,
[42:57] that [UNIT:Dreadknight] dies. It is game. And
[43:01] a dark Elar victory with a wellplaced
[43:05] free [STRATAGEM:Grenade] [UNIT:Stratagem]. Just free. You know
[43:08] how many mortal wounds he's done with
[43:09] free grenades? He did a free [STRATAGEM:Grenade]
[43:12] every single turn. So four turns, four
[43:14] [UNIT:Command Point]. He killed the the [UNIT:Kalidus Assassin]
[43:18] dead. Helped kill a [UNIT:Dreadknight]. Dead.
[43:20] Helped kill that unit. Absolutely didn't
[43:23] even no contest. And then killed that
[43:25] thing. That unit has done more damage by
[43:28] itself than most of the rest of my army.
[43:30] >> MVP.
[43:31] >> MVP. I don't know who plays [FACTION:Drukhari] that
[43:34] says that [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors] and [UNIT:Archon] are not
[43:36] good. You know what?
[43:38] >> I don't know what I'm talking about. I
[43:40] don't have 30 years of experience or,
[43:42] you know, 20 years with a single
[43:44] faction. Yeah, whatever. You know, leave
[43:46] it or take it, whatever you want. But
[43:48] let's take a look at the end game and
[43:50] come back with a little postgame chat.
[43:52] Uh, pointswise, Dukari, lots of points.
[43:55] Gray Knight's not as many points. Um,
[43:57] and it is a Dukari victory, but I
[44:00] really, really like this [UNIT:Skyweavers]
[44:02] version of my list. Thanks a lot for
[44:05] watching everybody and thanks for coming
[44:06] down for the game.
[44:07] >> Of course. My pleasure.
[44:08] >> That was super fun. We braved a
[44:10] snowstorm for this for you. That's
[44:12] right. That's right. We drove in the
[44:14] snow and it was terrifying just to do
[44:17] this.
[44:18] >> Worth it.
[44:18] >> That's right. Worth every penny. Did you
[44:20] learn some stuff?
[44:20] >> I did. I learned quite a bit.
[44:21] >> You don't get to play against Archelar
[44:23] like
[44:23] >> No. No, no, no, no. Just chose the best
[44:26] player to play against.
[44:27] >> Yeah, thanks. I'll take that. That makes
[44:29] my ego feel good.
[44:30] >> Just stroke it next time. It's a little
[44:32] bit
[44:32] >> That's right.
[44:33] >> Less salt in the wounds.
[44:34] >> That's right. I I just had to [UNIT:Terraforming Points]
[44:36] your home objective just to make it
[44:38] extra salty.
[44:39] >> I'm turn I'm turn five, too.
[44:41] >> Right. Yeah. And mine. Yeah. Nothing you
[44:44] can do about that. Thanks all for coming
[44:46] down. So, uh you How long have you been
[44:48] playing [FACTION:Grey Knights]?
[44:49] >> [FACTION:Grey Knights] since the end of eighth
[44:50] edition. Nice. So,
[44:52] >> hey, you've been playing enjoying the
[44:54] new codec so far.
[44:55] >> Yeah, for the most part. I wish it's a
[44:56] little bland. There's we there's stuff
[44:59] we're missing.
[45:00] >> There's, you know, hopefully, you know,
[45:01] we see some cool stuff. You have a lot
[45:02] of detachment to choose from and things
[45:04] like that. Like unit options or little
[45:06] Let us know if you're a Gray Eye player
[45:07] or no Grae player. Let us know down
[45:09] below like what would you do to sort of
[45:11] like add some flavor?
[45:13] >> What I was saying during our game was
[45:15] that hammers. He wants hammers.
[45:16] >> Oh, my hammer's
[45:17] >> that hit on twos. I would hope
[45:20] >> maybe a [UNIT:Grand Master] should have weapon
[45:22] skill ballista skill two plus you know
[45:24] I'm just saying that might be good um
[45:27] for a like a chapter master level unit
[45:31] >> psychic things what I miss
[45:33] >> this is what [UNIT:Pain] does to me it makes me
[45:35] happy
[45:38] >> um other than that I really like this
[45:40] sppliner version so I was chatting uh
[45:44] with some folks in the art of war
[45:45] discord the dari discord and they were
[45:47] like oh I like [UNIT:Drazhar] Like Draar has
[45:49] been like hit or miss for me. He did
[45:50] okay. He killed one unit and then died.
[45:52] But I think I have to just get better at
[45:54] using him. The fact that he has a 6-in
[45:56] piling consolidate, I just haven't been
[45:57] able to see that. But I think in this
[45:59] detachment with [UNIT:Wraithlike Retreat], the
[46:01] piling six, consolidate six would
[46:03] actually work really well. Um, but I
[46:05] like this version of the list a lot more
[46:07] than with the [UNIT:Voidraven Bomber] bomber. It's
[46:08] sad to say I'm going to miss my void
[46:10] raven. But having more stuff, like I
[46:13] added in another [UNIT:Hellions] unit, two units
[46:16] of [UNIT:Reavers], like I added so
[46:19] much by taking the [UNIT:Voidraven Bomber] out and
[46:21] all of that stuff was what helped me
[46:22] play the game.
[46:23] >> Yeah, absolutely.
[46:24] >> Yeah, I had lots of little units and the
[46:27] damage output is still there.
[46:29] >> These heat lances.
[46:30] >> Yeah. Yeah, I've got heat lance, but I
[46:31] mean like this army, I did a lot more
[46:33] damage very quickly than I thought I
[46:35] would.
[46:35] >> Absolutely.
[46:36] >> Ignore cover and lots adds up
[46:39] >> over time.
[46:39] >> Oh yeah. Were you going to change your
[46:41] list at all?
[46:42] >> Cuz we'll have you back, of course.
[46:43] >> Oh, for sure. I appreciate it. I think I
[46:44] will. I'll probably take out a dread
[46:46] knight and fiddle around either with
[46:48] some sisters of battle, maybe put an
[46:49] emulator, but I might try some more
[46:51] [UNIT:Interceptors].
[46:52] I love [UNIT:Interceptors]. Shoot and scoot,
[46:55] move 12. They are very good
[46:56] >> and they're they're good with 622 RUI.
[46:58] Like it is
[46:59] >> especially with deep strike and you
[47:01] could 6 in and then shoot and then
[47:02] scoot. So you can actually get like some
[47:04] really good anti-objective plays like
[47:07] coming in really close, shooting, and
[47:08] then moving on to objectives instead of
[47:10] have Well, you could charge as well,
[47:11] too. But like, you know, I mean, it is
[47:13] what it is. It just gives you more
[47:14] options. Or drop down really close, go
[47:16] behind a wall. Anyway, old stuff that is
[47:18] like the dark elder army that goes, I
[47:21] like this
[47:21] >> just with a two-up save.
[47:23] >> Correct. Oh, a two-up save and two
[47:24] wounds and T4 so you don't just die to
[47:26] chain swords and bolt pistols.
[47:28] >> Yeah.
[47:29] >> What
[47:29] >> crazy dots.
[47:30] >> Thanks a lot for watching everybody.
