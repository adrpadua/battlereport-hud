[0:00] Hello and welcome to the Scardcast
[0:01] battle report. Today we've got Space
[0:03] Wolves versus [FACTION:Drukhari]. That's right. And
[0:05] I'm running all Coven against
[0:09] [UNIT:Stormlance]. Let's dive into the game.
[0:11] >> A dark kill.
[0:14] >> Welcome to another battle report. Of
[0:15] course, I've got Ben on hand. Oh, that's
[0:19] right. Back by popular demand. We're
[0:21] going to be playing, of course,
[0:22] practicing for the World Championships
[0:23] of Warhammer. And of course, Ben's
[0:25] practicing to go crush his local RTS. is
[0:28] better at Warhammer.
[0:29] >> That's right. So, we're playing Tak and
[0:31] Hold Hammer and Anvil. Let's take a look
[0:33] at on layout one, the army lists. Here
[0:37] we have 2,000 points of [FACTION:Drukhari]. Now, I
[0:39] am running the coven detachment. That's
[0:42] right. Himunculus Coven. One of the
[0:44] detachments I was very curious about and
[0:46] I really wanted to try. So, I got to
[0:48] bring out all my big gribblies and my
[0:50] [UNIT:Rax]. So, we have one [UNIT:Homunculus] with the
[0:54] enhancement to give his unit plus one
[0:55] toughness and give himself plus one
[0:57] wound. I have one [UNIT:Homunculus] with the
[0:59] enhancement to increase his aura by 3
[1:02] in. I have one big unit of 10 [UNIT:Rax] and
[1:05] three units of five [UNIT:Rax] with wizzy wig
[1:08] weapons. So what you see is what you get
[1:10] in terms of load out weapons, close car
[1:12] weapons, all that good stuff as well. I
[1:15] am bringing a large unit of 10
[1:17] [UNIT:Mandrakes]. The more I've been playing,
[1:19] the more I love this big unit. It just
[1:21] upy downies. Lots of attacks, lots of
[1:23] shooting as well. The meat and potatoes
[1:26] of the list are three units of two
[1:29] [UNIT:Talos].
[1:31] This is a unit that has an old [UNIT:Talos].
[1:34] That is awesome. So, he's got the
[1:36] splinter cannons, the ikra injector, and
[1:38] a macro scalpel. And this one has a
[1:40] layout as you see, haywire, twin link
[1:42] liquify, macro scalpel. And then we have
[1:45] two units of two with twin liquifier
[1:47] guns, gauntlets, and then one unit has
[1:50] haywire and one has heat launches to try
[1:52] and take out some tanks. Instead of
[1:55] heavy weapon [UNIT:Scourge], I have a unit of
[1:57] carbine [UNIT:Scourge] for the 6-in deep strike
[2:00] and a unit of two [UNIT:Cronos] uh with both
[2:04] guns. So, the flamer and the uh the what
[2:07] we call the butt gun. That's right. It's
[2:08] a little disc
[2:10] on his butt.
[2:13] And then we have 10 [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors]. I
[2:16] will never build a list without [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors]
[2:17] warriors. A [UNIT:Archon] with a soul trap and
[2:19] a husbade. And [UNIT:Lady Malys], who is my
[2:23] warlord, as well as five [UNIT:Incubi] with
[2:25] their shrine, and a Claex with claves.
[2:28] Rounding all out, we have a transport
[2:30] units with uh three [UNIT:Venom] and a [UNIT:Raider]
[2:32] to help split things and carry things
[2:34] around the battlefield. And there you
[2:36] have it, folks. 2,000 points on the
[2:38] nose. Let me know what you think with a
[2:40] comment down below. Here we have 2,000
[2:42] points of [FACTION:Space Wolves]. This time you
[2:44] brought Stormlands, Ben.
[2:46] >> Yeah, I'm trying to I don't know. Maybe
[2:48] if they ever change Sag of the Bold. I
[2:50] really want to go back.
[2:51] >> You tried.
[2:51] >> Those strats are so cool.
[2:52] >> You tried.
[2:53] >> Um but yeah, uh it's going to be led by
[2:55] [UNIT:Bjorn the Fell-Handed] the Fell-Handed with his Hellrost
[2:58] Canonan. Um it's going to be alongside
[3:01] [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist]. I'm going to have a wolf
[3:05] priest, a [UNIT:Wolf Guard Battle Leader] with
[3:08] fainting withdrawal, uh, [UNIT:Lieutenant]
[3:10] with combi weapon, which I just finished
[3:11] up painting a little while ago.
[3:13] >> Very cool. They look awesome. I love
[3:14] this gray. The gray on your army looks
[3:16] just fantastic.
[3:17] >> I just I'm not a huge fan of the light
[3:19] blue.
[3:19] >> There you go.
[3:20] >> Um, 10 [UNIT:Grey Hunters].
[3:21] >> Yep.
[3:22] >> T five [UNIT:Intercessor Squad].
[3:23] >> Yep.
[3:24] >> Uh, three [UNIT:Inceptor Squad], which I'm actually
[3:26] trying out [UNIT:Inceptor Squad] for the first time.
[3:27] >> With heavy bolters, too. Those are very
[3:29] dangerous. Six-in deep strike and heavy
[3:31] bolters kill lots of dark elder.
[3:33] >> I just feel like the the plasma doesn't
[3:34] have enough shots.
[3:35] >> Yeah.
[3:35] >> Uh five [UNIT:Infiltrator Squad]. Uh five [UNIT:Scout Squad].
[3:38] Six wolfg guard heavy headtakers with
[3:41] shields.
[3:42] >> No wolves with them.
[3:43] >> No wolves with them cuz like I only want
[3:45] to take them in units of three. Don't
[3:47] want to take the six.
[3:48] >> Um and then five [UNIT:Wolfguard] [UNIT:Terminator Squad].
[3:51] Um six [UNIT:Thunderwolf Cavalry], fiveian
[3:53] wolves, a [UNIT:Gladiator Lancer], and a
[3:56] [UNIT:Whirlwind].
[3:56] >> And [UNIT:Scout Squad].
[3:58] >> [UNIT:Scout Squad]. I don't know if you said [UNIT:Scout Squad],
[4:00] but
[4:00] >> I did say [UNIT:Scout Squad].
[4:01] >> [UNIT:Scout Squad]. There you have it. 2,000 points.
[4:03] I love it. Let's dive into deployment.
[4:06] I'm really glad you decided to try storm
[4:08] lance.
[4:09] >> Well, I want I really want to go back to
[4:10] the bold, but the spaceold attachments
[4:12] need a little bit of work. And the one
[4:14] thing I want the most is I just want a
[4:16] regular character to join the
[4:17] [UNIT:Terminator Squad].
[4:17] >> No,
[4:19] please.
[4:20] >> Attacker defender.
[4:22] I get so much hate online for this. I
[4:25] will. Oh, for the first time in like
[4:27] seven games, I get to defend. I'm going
[4:30] to put down my [UNIT:Mandrakes] and take up all
[4:31] of the midboard. That's all me.
[4:33] >> It's my midboard.
[4:34] >> No, it isn't. Okay, so I'll defend
[4:37] >> back after deployment. I did redeploy. I
[4:40] put [UNIT:Mandrakes] in the middle of the board
[4:41] to prevent the [UNIT:Scout Squad] or the uh real
[4:44] >> the uh loanup [UNIT:Lieutenant] from taking up
[4:47] space and then using malicees read. Yes,
[4:49] she's not on in a transport. Okay,
[4:51] internet. Even though I it should work
[4:53] in a transport. Whatever. I'm playing it
[4:56] the way that all of the you know I don't
[4:58] know lawyers out there are talking
[5:00] about. It's fine. It's fine. Whatever.
[5:01] Whatever. Um I've got lights ready to
[5:04] sticky that. Five [UNIT:Rax] with my uh
[5:08] better aura.
[5:10] 10 [UNIT:Rax] in the [UNIT:Raider] heat lots [UNIT:Talos]
[5:13] the two [UNIT:Cronos] and then five [UNIT:Rax] back
[5:16] here in that venom. I've got the [UNIT:Archon]
[5:18] with the Cablite warriors in that venom.
[5:20] to the hodgepodge [UNIT:Talos] unit. So in
[5:23] reserve I do have deep striking
[5:25] [UNIT:Mandrakes] which I redeployed. I also
[5:27] used the second redeploy on the east
[5:28] [UNIT:Talos] to kind of scoot them up this way
[5:30] and this [UNIT:Talos] unit to be a little bit
[5:32] more conservative once I found out where
[5:34] the laer was going. I have the [UNIT:Scourge]
[5:37] in reserve deep strike. I've got the two
[5:40] [UNIT:Talos] with haywire blasters in reserve
[5:43] and I have a five strong unit of [UNIT:Rax]
[5:46] in strategic reserve as well. We have
[5:49] [UNIT:Bjorn the Fell-Handed], the [UNIT:Infiltrator Squad], a laer, a
[5:52] [UNIT:Whirlwind], the [UNIT:Scout Squad] back there, the
[5:54] [UNIT:Thunderwolf Cavalry] calf, and raising wolves,
[5:56] the [UNIT:Grey Hunters] with the priest. Uh,
[6:00] not the priest, the [UNIT:Battle Leader].
[6:01] [UNIT:Battle Leader].
[6:02] >> Then we have the priest with the uh head
[6:04] hunters, last but not least, the loadout
[6:07] [UNIT:Lieutenant]. And in reserve, we have our
[6:08] jack and the [UNIT:Terminator Squad] in deep strike.
[6:10] And of course, oh, and then the
[6:11] [UNIT:Intercessor Squad] to sticky, that objective.
[6:13] Like, imagine if you played a game
[6:15] without what we call sticky objectives.
[6:18] This would be so open. And that would be
[6:20] so open. How do you play against Tao? H
[6:22] how?
[6:23] >> You just lose.
[6:24] >> You fight them.
[6:25] >> You fight them. You go punch them. I
[6:26] guess that's true. And uh and that's
[6:28] that. So you've decided this is going to
[6:30] be the prey. I remember to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] once
[6:32] to wound.
[6:33] >> I actually remember it.
[6:34] >> I see.
[6:35] >> And with that, let's go to the roll. Are
[6:38] you ready, Ben?
[6:39] >> Oh, I hope so.
[6:40] >> Okay. Turn one. I roll the five. You
[6:42] roll the three. That is [FACTION:Drukhari] turn
[6:45] number one.
[6:45] >> That's right. You go. No, I don't want
[6:47] to go first. You know I don't want to go
[6:49] first.
[6:50] >> Okay, so uh of course Ben is the
[6:52] attacker in red. I am the defender in
[6:55] green. We're playing hammer and anvil
[6:56] take and hold. Hold one, hold two, hold
[6:58] three for five points each. And of
[7:00] course you've got our command points and
[7:02] the battle round. This this down here is
[7:05] our battle ready, which we are battle
[7:07] ready. And then of course we have our
[7:08] primary and secondary score. We'll be
[7:12] keeping track throughout the whole game.
[7:13] So, here we have cleanse and storm
[7:15] hostile objective. Uh, storm hostile
[7:17] objective is going to be a redraw
[7:21] into no prisoners. Okay, so no
[7:23] prisoners. There's not much I can do to
[7:24] kill anything. It's probably going to be
[7:26] a pain uh pain token, a uh command point
[7:29] and then cleanse, of course. Going to
[7:30] try get up and press some buttons. I
[7:33] also get a single pain token. Really
[7:35] excited to try out the coven stuff. So,
[7:38] essentially, we're going to move up.
[7:39] We're going to basic go try cleanse this
[7:41] objective here. going to probably move
[7:43] up and try to cleanse that objective
[7:44] there and then just stage and then see
[7:47] what Ben does. But my turn one is going
[7:49] to be pretty straightforward. The key
[7:50] here is not to do too much and turn a
[7:54] turn one into a bad deployment. So
[7:56] that's so key. Well, as I said, my turn
[7:59] was going to be pretty fast. The [UNIT:Talos]
[8:01] have moved up to cut the angle from the
[8:02] [UNIT:Plasmancer]. The [UNIT:Archon] has moved up to
[8:04] essentially uh Oh, it just moved up. You
[8:06] know what I am going to do? I'm going to
[8:08] disembark this unit, though. They're
[8:10] just going to be like right on the
[8:11] objective. Yeah, I just noticed that
[8:12] now. I'm going to do that now. Okay, so
[8:14] there. Yeah, going to get out. Hopefully
[8:15] sticking that objective and just being
[8:17] able to move on. The [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors] are
[8:19] sticky in my home now or now control
[8:21] home just going to move out towards the
[8:23] back to screen out this little area.
[8:25] This unit of Rex got out of the venom.
[8:27] [UNIT:Lady Malys] got in the venom. Both [UNIT:Venom]
[8:29] advanced into this little pocket. Got
[8:30] the [UNIT:Cronos] hanging out here. The [UNIT:Talos]
[8:32] just moving up the side here. So I did
[8:34] move the [UNIT:Raider] with the spin. Was able
[8:36] to get on the objective to do cleanse.
[8:38] And then I decided to get out with the
[8:39] [UNIT:Rax]. If I stay in there, what happens
[8:41] is they charge me, they blow this up,
[8:43] then they get out, then that's battle
[8:44] shock. So, I can't use any strats on
[8:46] that unit, and that would not be good. I
[8:48] want to make sure that with uh my
[8:49] strategim, I can for a two plus bring my
[8:52] Hunoculus back to life. Kind of like
[8:55] it's like budget Urian Urian Raton. So,
[8:58] with that, let's go to the scoreboard. I
[8:59] do double cleanse and I'm going to get
[9:01] rid of no prisoners for a command point.
[9:02] So that'll be double cleanse gives me a
[9:05] five points on secondaries and an extra
[9:07] command point as I discard no prisoners.
[9:11] And with that we move on to turn number
[9:14] one for the space wools. Would you like
[9:16] to pull your [UNIT:Scout Squad]?
[9:19] >> No.
[9:19] >> No. They're going to stay where they are
[9:21] just in case you do like recover assets
[9:23] or something.
[9:23] >> Good to get the practice. Whatever.
[9:25] >> Okay. You go up to 3 CP thanks to
[9:28] [UNIT:Bjorn the Fell-Handed]. So do I.
[9:30] and cards assassination and engage. So,
[9:34] I've got one character in that blob.
[9:36] I've got one character in each of those
[9:38] [UNIT:Venom] and a character over here as
[9:40] well. So, I'm curious to see what Ben
[9:43] does. Ben,
[9:45] >> I forgot something.
[9:46] >> You forgot something. How dare you
[9:48] forget something.
[9:49] >> You can oath it now. It's fine.
[9:50] >> No, it's not oath. It's I got to pick
[9:52] the quarry.
[9:53] >> Ah, you can also do that. I don't care.
[9:54] >> Like,
[9:54] >> pick whatever you want.
[9:56] >> Eeny meenie miny mo. How dare you. Is
[9:58] it?
[9:59] >> I can position against them.
[10:00] >> No,
[10:01] >> you said whatever.
[10:02] >> I said you can. You can. Absolutely. So,
[10:04] you decided to oath my [UNIT:Rax]. You're
[10:06] going to try and battleshock them with a
[10:07] [UNIT:Whirlwind]. They're only leadership
[10:08] seven. So, you're trying to stop that
[10:10] postmortality strategy from happening.
[10:12] You're spending 2 CP to auto advance.
[10:16] End of the movement phase. You've
[10:17] decided to not overcommit anything else.
[10:20] You don't want to just bring all your
[10:21] stuff out. Come on. But I want to be
[10:23] able to shoot you and fight you.
[10:24] >> I know you don't.
[10:26] >> Okay. So, you've got the [UNIT:Whirlwind].
[10:28] What's it going?
[10:29] >> Uh, it's going right
[10:30] >> into them. Okay, I like it.
[10:32] >> So, D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D
[10:32] D D D 6 plus three blast, so D6 plus
[10:35] five
[10:35] >> and then we'll come back off to
[10:36] shooting. Wow, the [UNIT:Whirlwind] got max
[10:38] shots. I spent one of my CP and a pain
[10:40] token to basically armor contempt my
[10:43] [UNIT:Rax]. You still killed five of them
[10:45] >> and the only save you rolled was a six.
[10:46] >> And I only rolled a six, so it was a
[10:48] wasted, but I got my pain token back for
[10:50] that. And you uh I you killed five. They
[10:53] thankfully passed their battleshock
[10:55] test, which is I needed that to happen.
[10:58] Okay, good. Now you get to do some
[11:00] charges.
[11:01] >> Y
[11:01] >> and the charge phase, that was a lower
[11:03] charge, so they're just going to be able
[11:04] to fight the [UNIT:Raider] because you didn't
[11:06] want to risk failing the charge
[11:08] completely.
[11:08] >> Yeah,
[11:09] >> that I I got off lightly there, but that
[11:11] was the right that was the right idea.
[11:13] >> Yeah.
[11:14] >> Okay, so here we have it. So after the
[11:17] fighting, I only did one wound to a to a
[11:19] head hunter and one wound to your
[11:22] priest. However, I did hit you. So you
[11:24] owe me a battle shock test, please. At
[11:26] minus one leadership, thanks to my
[11:28] [UNIT:Homunculus].
[11:30] >> N you're fine. So I was hoping for
[11:31] another pain token. However, I'm going
[11:32] to use one command point for poisonous
[11:34] art.
[11:35] >> And now you're poisoned for the rest of
[11:37] the game. I'm going to roll a dice at
[11:39] every command phase on a four plus. No,
[11:42] he's going to be dead. He's going to be
[11:44] dead by then. I'm gonna poke him to
[11:45] death. And that's it. Dead. And we go to
[11:48] the scoreboard. You will get a two-point
[11:50] engage. And are you getting rid of
[11:51] assassinate or are you keeping
[11:52] assassinate? Actually, you might as well
[11:54] keep it. And if you if you kill me in my
[11:57] turn, then you get it.
[11:59] >> All you have to do to prevent that
[12:00] though is walk away.
[12:00] >> Yeah. But then you can just throw away
[12:02] throw it away. It's not like you get an
[12:03] extra command point cuz you already get
[12:05] an extra one. So you might as well hold
[12:07] on to it and force me to potentially run
[12:09] away, right? Like that's
[12:10] >> Yeah. Run away.
[12:11] >> No. Never. Yeah. Maybe. Okay. So, with
[12:15] that though, on to battle round number
[12:17] two, where I will get another command
[12:19] point and you will get a command point.
[12:21] As for cards,
[12:24] we're going to go ahead and do behind
[12:26] enemy lines
[12:28] and marked for death. So, we'll see what
[12:32] that is. I'm going to get 10 points.
[12:34] Five here and five there. And I will be
[12:36] stickying that objective as well. I'm
[12:39] starting to take over the table as I
[12:41] tend to do. Uh my [UNIT:Scourge] decided to
[12:43] deep strike here because I have behind
[12:45] any lines. So I wanted uh three points.
[12:47] Uh my [UNIT:Archon] moved in and is staging
[12:49] behind this building. The [UNIT:Talos] have
[12:51] moved up. I still have two [UNIT:Talos] in
[12:53] strategic reserve. The [UNIT:Mandrakes] have
[12:55] deep struck to create a nice little just
[12:58] straight through here to so no [UNIT:Inceptor Squad]
[13:00] can drop down in here. I need to keep
[13:02] the [UNIT:Inceptor Squad] not in my deployment zone.
[13:04] >> Tying up enough points with those
[13:05] [UNIT:Inceptor Squad]. That makes me happy.
[13:06] >> Oh that's [UNIT:Inceptor Squad] are great for that.
[13:08] The same as why I have got my little
[13:10] 6-in deep striker guys. Oh, I can't do
[13:12] that. That is illegal. So, uh 12 in from
[13:17] [UNIT:Infiltrator Squad]. I did forget that.
[13:19] >> I have these guys here.
[13:20] >> Yeah. Yeah. So, 9 in out that way. So,
[13:23] they can't get inside of the deployment
[13:24] zone. So, I'm not going to be able to
[13:25] get bring it down, but I needed to push
[13:27] up cuz [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress] [UNIT:Terminator Squad], I
[13:29] didn't want them like here. I didn't
[13:31] want them here because I need to try and
[13:32] hold primary. That's the whole reason
[13:34] I'm pushing sacrificing a unit for
[13:36] points, right? So, that's super
[13:38] important, especially when going first.
[13:39] I can't let Ben take away my primary
[13:42] points. Uh, the [UNIT:Homunculus] with the extra
[13:45] aura is moved out over here. And then we
[13:47] have basically everything else trying to
[13:48] fight. I got [UNIT:Lady Malys] out to get the
[13:50] Vector there. There. There's a couple of
[13:52] folks in range of that [UNIT:Lieutenant]. And
[13:55] I've got the Cronis, the [UNIT:Talos], the
[13:57] Venom, the [UNIT:Incubi], the reserve unit of
[14:00] Rax back here all looking at these head
[14:02] hunters, which by the way, one of them
[14:04] died to what?
[14:05] >> Poison.
[14:06] >> That's right. I poisoned them. I rolled
[14:07] a four up and I did three mortal wounds.
[14:09] >> I think you got me like that scared.
[14:12] >> Heck,
[14:12] >> I should get an invulnerable save if he
[14:13] got poisoned.
[14:14] >> Nope.
[14:14] >> Well, I want to say that load up
[14:16] [UNIT:Lieutenant] in the shooting phase passed
[14:18] every save and feel no pain against
[14:20] everything that shot at him, but did
[14:22] fail
[14:23] and one venom.
[14:25] >> I gave you so many two damage attacks.
[14:27] >> You want to talk about everything
[14:28] shooting?
[14:31] >> The [UNIT:Head Hunters] are they they fell into
[14:33] my trap.
[14:34] >> The dark al came up too late. They did.
[14:36] They came out to play and you did pass
[14:38] the battle shock test there even though
[14:39] I shot you with like three different
[14:41] rack units or two rack units. Uh only
[14:43] one actually hit stuff and then you you
[14:45] failed your battle shock there from the
[14:46] rack. So I did get a paint token for
[14:48] that. With that, let's do some charges.
[14:50] >> No.
[14:51] >> Um yeah, just going to charge stuff.
[14:53] >> Well, well, well, well, I made a ninest
[14:54] charge to get into the lone [UNIT:Lieutenant]
[14:56] with the uh [UNIT:Talos]. They did not make it
[14:58] in, and I did make it in with [UNIT:Lady Malys],
[15:00] but you passed your battle shock test,
[15:02] so no extra battle shock shenanigans for
[15:04] me. However,
[15:05] >> they ain't scared.
[15:06] >> They're not scared. They're like afraid
[15:07] of no ghosts.
[15:08] >> They're not ghosts, I guess.
[15:09] >> I guess.
[15:10] >> Yeah, that's true. Okay, end of the
[15:12] fight. [UNIT:Lady Malys] and [UNIT:Incubi] got a paint
[15:14] token. Killed both unit. So, I got a
[15:16] consolation mark for death. And then the
[15:17] [UNIT:Talos] just murdered that lone
[15:20] [UNIT:Lieutenant]. Just absolutely murdered it.
[15:22] >> It was real.
[15:22] >> That was And then at the end of the
[15:23] fight phase, he's going to fall into
[15:25] into this transport. Uh, no, he's not.
[15:28] He's going to stay right there. You
[15:29] know, whatever. He's he's gonna Anything
[15:32] that dies gives me pain tokens when he's
[15:34] around of my stuff just as much as your
[15:37] stuff. So, I'm just going to try to get
[15:39] as many pain tokens as I can so I can
[15:41] use them for everything.
[15:43] So, so there's your oath target and we
[15:46] go onto the scoreboard. So, I do get
[15:48] marked for death for two points. So,
[15:51] I'll go up to seven over here like this.
[15:54] Oh, you did get your engage for two
[15:55] points which I didn't give you there.
[15:57] And uh I will just pitch behind enemy
[15:59] lines for CP. So I go up to 3 CP as we
[16:02] move on to your turn. Are you up to 3
[16:04] CP?
[16:04] >> Are you going to get rid of assassinate
[16:05] or keep it?
[16:06] >> Uh get rid of it.
[16:07] >> Going to get rid of it.
[16:08] >> Uh no wait keep it. I will
[16:10] >> you're going to keep it.
[16:10] >> Yeah, cuz he's
[16:11] >> he's right there. That's like free.
[16:12] That's that's five points right there.
[16:14] >> So you're going to keep it and you get
[16:16] one more card.
[16:18] >> Are you going to pull your [UNIT:Scout Squad] up?
[16:19] Oh, that'll give me that'll give me five
[16:20] points.
[16:21] >> A cleanse. Press buttons in the middle
[16:23] of the board as we go into get. You get
[16:26] three. I get four. And you do get five
[16:29] points on uh primary because you hold
[16:32] your home objective.
[16:33] >> I can press buttons.
[16:34] >> You can press buttons. If you can get
[16:36] there,
[16:39] >> I'll get there. End of the movement
[16:40] phase. So Bjorn and Lzer moved out. You
[16:43] want to try Dmech my [UNIT:Archon] and his uh
[16:47] cabites. You've got the big unit of
[16:49] [UNIT:Intercessor Squad], the [UNIT:Infiltrator Squad] all kind
[16:50] of moving up. You need to kill some
[16:52] trash to make some space. The grey
[16:54] hunters are moving out into the in the
[16:55] pocket.
[16:56] >> They're hunting greatly.
[16:57] >> That's right. They're greatly hunting.
[16:58] And then over here, we've got the
[17:00] [UNIT:Thunderbolt] finally going to try and
[17:01] kill some [UNIT:Talos]. You just have to try
[17:03] and overload to try and kind of shift
[17:05] the momentum of the battle. You're
[17:07] keeping the [UNIT:Terminator Squad] and the
[17:08] [UNIT:Inceptor Squad] in the sky, forcing me to put
[17:11] resources to continue to screen.
[17:14] However, I rapid ingressed my double
[17:16] unit of [UNIT:Talos] with haywire blasters
[17:19] because your mechanized forces over
[17:21] here. And then of course you use your
[17:23] [UNIT:Whirlwind] to kind of screen the back and
[17:24] your [UNIT:Scout Squad] have moved up on the side.
[17:26] With that, let's go into the shooting
[17:28] phase. And I hope you like what we're
[17:30] doing here. But uh this is the kind of
[17:32] thing if you feel pinned in, you have to
[17:34] get out of the jail or and the hammer
[17:36] and ammo could be a little tricky
[17:37] because all the objectives are right in
[17:38] the middle of the board and if you don't
[17:39] come out to play,
[17:41] >> you just won't score any points.
[17:43] >> So you have to come out to play. Okay,
[17:45] shooting. You were able to pop the
[17:46] venom, kill almost all of the cabite
[17:48] wars, kill the entire unit of [UNIT:Scourge].
[17:50] Uh, kill all of the [UNIT:Rax]. I went to
[17:52] ground to try to save him, but that
[17:54] plasma pistol got really fancy and
[17:55] killed the last guy, but I didn't get a
[17:57] paint token for that kill. Um, and then
[18:00] you put a couple of wounds on the [UNIT:Talos].
[18:02] So, into the charge phase. End of the
[18:05] shooting/charge phase. You did kill the
[18:07] venom, the c the [UNIT:Rax]. You weren't able
[18:09] to get the [UNIT:Homunculus]. You did get the
[18:11] [UNIT:Talos] that killed one with a fight on
[18:13] death. And then you piled into my
[18:14] [UNIT:Homunculus] to sort of like tie him up, I
[18:17] guess. And uh he poisoned you with the
[18:20] strategm. And because of his aura, every
[18:22] time a unit of mine dies within 9 in or
[18:25] 6 in, I get on a four plus a pain token.
[18:27] So I have a stack of pain tokens.
[18:30] >> There's so much pain.
[18:31] >> So many pain tokens. And then they
[18:32] charge and kill the venom. However, no
[18:34] secondaries for you. So are you going to
[18:36] keep any of them? Getting rid of any of
[18:37] them? Not that you get any CP for it.
[18:40] >> I know.
[18:41] >> That's right. Um, assassinate. It feels
[18:43] foolish to get rid of assassinate with a
[18:45] character so so exposed.
[18:48] >> Um, but I will get rid of cleanse
[18:50] because I'm not going to
[18:51] >> get rid of cleanse.
[18:51] >> I'm not going to be doing any actions
[18:53] right now.
[18:53] >> Makes sense for me. Uh, so with that,
[18:55] we're on to battle round number three.
[18:58] And I did put my [UNIT:Mandrakes] up in the
[19:00] sky. So, let's take a look at the
[19:02] scoreboard. So, it is turn number three
[19:04] now. I get another 10 points on primary.
[19:05] I will get locust and recover assets.
[19:07] You're still on assassination. and our
[19:09] command points go up as such. So, in
[19:12] terms of primary, I've definitely been
[19:13] able to control the pace of the game.
[19:15] So, what am I going to try to do? The
[19:16] [UNIT:Talos] are going to try and move up and
[19:18] deal with [UNIT:Bjorn the Fell-Handed] and [UNIT:Plasmancer]. The [UNIT:Archon]
[19:20] is going to have to take a battle shock
[19:22] test. And he's okay. So, he's no longer
[19:24] battle shocked or he's not battle
[19:27] shocked there. Great. So, he's going to
[19:28] be good there. The Mandre are probably
[19:30] going to come down. I have Thunder
[19:31] Wolves. I need to deal with them. This
[19:32] just like I have to do it. I'm going to
[19:35] spend a pain token on that unit of [UNIT:Rax]
[19:38] in the corner back over there. Uh, do I
[19:40] get it back on a five? I do not. And I
[19:42] bring back
[19:43] >> finally,
[19:44] >> I bring back D3+ one. So, three more
[19:47] [UNIT:Rax] come back. So, my 10 strong unit
[19:49] is back to full strength.
[19:50] >> Yeah, after they ran away and hit
[19:52] >> they hit the corner just to come back
[19:54] and fight another day. Well done. And
[19:57] you still have your [UNIT:Terminator Squad] and your
[19:58] [UNIT:Inceptor Squad] to come in, but you did put a
[20:01] lot of pressure on the midboard. So,
[20:02] let's see. cuz I don't know if I can
[20:04] deal with everything. One, yes. Two, I
[20:07] don't think so. Maybe I can soften them
[20:09] up a little bit. So, we'll see what we
[20:10] can do. End of the movement phase. The
[20:12] [UNIT:Talos] have just moved around to get in
[20:14] range of these two. The [UNIT:Archon] has moved
[20:16] up and we've got [UNIT:Kabalite Warriors] [UNIT:Rax] just
[20:19] kind of creating a bit of a screen. The
[20:20] [UNIT:Mandrakes] have come back down again
[20:22] outside nine of the [UNIT:Thunderwolf Cavalry] cav, but
[20:24] uh ready to shoot them as well. The big
[20:26] unit of [UNIT:Rax] has moved up. The [UNIT:Lady Malys]
[20:28] has gotten out getting aggressive. And
[20:30] of course, we brought in the [UNIT:Cronos]. Are
[20:32] you going to [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress] anything,
[20:33] bud?
[20:33] >> Rapidly
[20:34] >> rapidly ingress. Of course, my little
[20:36] [UNIT:Homunculus] on that side as well. Decided
[20:38] to fall back and have his nice little
[20:41] 9-in bubble of death of uh auras and
[20:44] stuff just being there. Um, cool.
[20:47] Rapidressing the [UNIT:Terminator Squad] right
[20:49] there. Okay, you have to start getting
[20:51] them involved. Of course, they have
[20:52] advancing charge in [UNIT:Stormlance], so they
[20:54] can get a little bit more aggressive.
[20:56] Let's see what we can do as we move into
[20:57] the shooting phase. Okay, so shooting
[20:59] wise, I got some more battle shocks
[21:01] thanks to all my [UNIT:Rax]. Battleshock.
[21:02] Battle shocked and having the homocus
[21:03] novi. I really like it. I'm up to that
[21:06] many. That's 10 pain tokens. I threw a
[21:10] [STRATAGEM:Grenade]. I killed [UNIT:Bjorn the Fell-Handed] with a bunch of
[21:12] haywire. Oh, they killed [UNIT:Bjorn the Fell-Handed]. So, no,
[21:14] that was an extra two. Yes. Okay. So, I
[21:16] did get that. Nice.
[21:17] >> You don't even have enough tokens.
[21:18] >> That's right. I I run out of tokens.
[21:20] That's it. I don't It should has to be a
[21:21] dice at this point. With that, let's do
[21:23] some charges. The [UNIT:Archon] is going to try
[21:25] charging some [UNIT:Infiltrator Squad]. No. Uh,
[21:28] that's not That's not far enough. He's
[21:30] just going to sit there and look pretty.
[21:31] Uh, the [UNIT:Cronos] are going to charge into
[21:33] this [UNIT:Wolf Guard [Legends]] pack. Nope.
[21:37] Sure. And then we've got Rex and [UNIT:Lady Malys]
[21:40] charging into there. But because I
[21:41] battleshocked, I get to try the really
[21:43] cool dev wound twin link thing. Oh, I
[21:46] can't wait. I'm going to show it off.
[21:47] We're going to roll it out so we can see
[21:49] what it does. So, I'm use 2CP for
[21:51] Distillers of Fear. So, every one of
[21:53] their weapons gets devastating wounds.
[21:55] If they were fighting against infantry,
[21:56] they're all like anti-infantry weapons.
[21:58] That would be very good. Um, and I'm
[22:00] going to use their experimental
[22:02] creations or whatever to make them with
[22:04] a pain token. Four attacks each, but
[22:07] hazardous. Yeah,
[22:08] >> they're all going to die.
[22:09] >> That's it'll be great.
[22:10] >> No, wait. At max half could die from
[22:12] that,
[22:12] >> maybe. We'll see. All right, so hitting
[22:14] on threes. These are the non- twin link
[22:16] cuz I have um I have four weapons that
[22:19] are range weapons in there. So, four
[22:22] that are not twin l that are not twin
[22:24] linked. Straight fours being fives, but
[22:26] sixes are devs. One death. Yeah. And one
[22:29] save a minus one.
[22:30] >> You can [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] these. Right.
[22:31] >> No, these are the non- twin linked.
[22:32] >> Oh, right. Right.
[22:33] >> And then we have six more. But these are
[22:35] twin linked. Threes to hit you. If they
[22:38] if they do hit right, there we go. Not
[22:40] terrible. Fives with twin linked. I'm
[22:43] just going to fish. Come on. Dev wounds.
[22:47] Okay. So, two deer,
[22:50] very very fun. Two dev wounds. Very
[22:52] nicely done. And four saves at AP1.
[22:55] Well, maybe it's not really good against
[22:57] non- infantry, but it was worth the
[22:58] experiment nonetheless.
[23:01] >> Uh, go through.
[23:03] >> Three plus two devs. Yeah. So, five.
[23:06] >> Yeah. So, he's dead and he's dead.
[23:08] >> Yeah. So, one, two, three, four. And
[23:10] then one guy is at two wounds. Oh, are
[23:12] they four wounds each? They're four
[23:13] wounds each.
[23:14] >> Okay. And then my [UNIT:Homunculus] hitting on
[23:16] twos.
[23:17] >> Yeah. And he needs
[23:21] >> uh sixes because he's only strength
[23:22] three.
[23:24] No. Good talk. Well, okay, fine. You
[23:28] didn't want to show off. Great. Just on
[23:30] camera. Got a little camera shot. Fine.
[23:33] Uh, let's see if [UNIT:Lady Malys] can just finish
[23:34] the job here.
[23:35] >> Crazy.
[23:36] >> Oh, they're shout their storm shield
[23:38] showed up and they made like so many
[23:40] involves against my [UNIT:Incubi]. But there's
[23:42] one left and one with um one wound. So,
[23:46] there's five wounds left in the unit.
[23:48] >> They do get to fight me back though.
[23:49] What do they fight back at?
[23:50] >> Oh, the [UNIT:Incubi]. Oh,
[23:52] >> they are not going to kill those [UNIT:Rax].
[23:55] >> Okay, well, you didn't kill anything
[23:56] either. I made some saves, too, on my
[23:58] [UNIT:Incubi]. Nice.
[23:59] >> Can't jump back in your venom like that.
[24:00] >> No, I know they're stuck now. Wow. But
[24:03] [UNIT:Lady Malys] is not afraid. So, with that,
[24:06] let's go to the scoreboard. Of course,
[24:07] at the start of the battle round, you
[24:09] will not be battleshocked. However, his
[24:12] aura will make them all take battleshock
[24:14] tests because you're under starting
[24:15] strength anyways.
[24:16] >> They do anyways, but they will as well.
[24:18] Hold on. Now, we'll go we'll let's let's
[24:20] go. Well, let's go to the scoreboard
[24:22] first. I'm getting excited. So, for
[24:23] recover assets, I did it with my
[24:27] uh nothing. I didn't do it with
[24:29] anything. Yeah, didn't could have done
[24:31] it with the venom. Could have done it
[24:32] with anything. Nope. So, I'm just going
[24:33] to get rid of it. I'm just going to get
[24:34] rid of uh recover and locust. Just going
[24:37] to stitch them. They're actionbased
[24:38] secondaries. I don't like them. And uh
[24:41] I'm going to get a Kathon point.
[24:44] And that was my third turn. So, I went
[24:46] up to 20. So, we're going to your turn.
[24:48] You will get a uh oh this is where
[24:50] battle show. So you have assassination.
[24:51] Are you keeping it?
[24:53] >> Uh yes.
[24:55] >> Okay. You draw one more card. You will
[24:58] go up to only two command points.
[24:59] >> Stronghold.
[25:00] >> Okay. So you're going to try and hold
[25:01] your home and of course kill that. I
[25:03] will go up to two command points as
[25:05] well. Battleshock time.
[25:09] >> Okay.
[25:11] >> Okay. At minus one. They are not
[25:14] battleshock. They're holding the line.
[25:16] >> Uh but I have to do it again for them,
[25:17] right? No, no, no. It's I think it's
[25:19] it's in the battle shock step. If you're
[25:21] wounded, you take it. So,
[25:22] >> and at minus one as well. That's big for
[25:25] primary. Yes,
[25:27] >> they are.
[25:27] >> I can't choose to auto pass.
[25:29] >> Uh, let me check. So, you would have
[25:31] auto passed there, of course, cuz it is
[25:32] primary. So, you'll get 10 points on
[25:33] primary. And you did pass that
[25:35] battleshock test. Nothing crazy. Let's
[25:37] move on to the movement phase. You will
[25:39] go up to 10 points. So, you're up to 15
[25:42] now. Nice. Keeping it nice and close.
[25:44] But in the secondary game, I guess we're
[25:45] both kind of sucking. So, but you're at
[25:47] zero CP to my two CP. Okay, awesome.
[25:52] Let's dive into the movement phase.
[25:53] They're still poisoned.
[25:55] >> Four plus.
[25:56] >> Oh, it's in every
[25:56] >> Yeah, it's every command phase. You take
[25:59] a border with
[26:00] >> Yeah, he's dead.
[26:00] >> No, no, this guy's got the cool claw.
[26:02] This guy dies.
[26:03] >> Okay, dead.
[26:05] >> He's got the horse heresy.
[26:08] >> People said you're poison.
[26:10] >> People said that strategy wasn't any
[26:12] >> I absolutely love that strategy.
[26:13] >> I think it's killed two wolves though.
[26:14] It's killed. No, it killed a wolf and it
[26:17] killed a Oh, and another wolf. Yeah,
[26:19] it's killed two wolves and a head hunter
[26:20] so far. Good use of CP. End of the move
[26:24] phase. We had the scepters drop down.
[26:26] Going to nuke some cavalite warriors.
[26:28] You decided to to ignore my [UNIT:Talos] except
[26:30] for a [UNIT:Plasmancer].
[26:31] >> Yeah.
[26:31] >> Uh they stayed still. They stayed still
[26:34] for heavy. They stayed still for heavy.
[26:36] >> The [UNIT:Terminator Squad] have advanced up. You're
[26:38] just rushing that side of the table with
[26:40] everything. Oh no. And the [UNIT:Scout Squad] of
[26:42] course in the sky just waiting.
[26:45] >> Hammer is ranged. Is assault.
[26:47] >> His assault. No, you can have Oh, boo.
[26:50] It's in.
[26:50] >> We'll come back after the shooting
[26:51] phase, but now now is your time to
[26:53] shine. You have assassination. Third
[26:54] time's a charm. Will you get
[26:56] assassination this time?
[26:57] >> Uh, well, we're going to try. We're
[26:58] going to try.
[26:59] >> Yeah. Yeah, we're going to try bite him
[27:00] to death.
[27:01] >> I mean, over here. Over there.
[27:03] >> Okay. I see. I see.
[27:05] >> Shooting phase. The entire unit of
[27:07] [UNIT:Intercessor Squad] and [UNIT:Infiltrator Squad] shot my
[27:10] [UNIT:Archon] and didn't kill them because I
[27:13] blew I used the CP for smoke launchers.
[27:16] Smoke grenades. Smoke it.
[27:17] >> Which is something new with the fantasm
[27:19] [STRATAGEM:Grenade] launchers which is awesome. I
[27:20] was like which actually kept me alive.
[27:22] But then the [UNIT:Whirlwind] decided to get
[27:24] nine shots.
[27:26] Nine shots and nuke my [UNIT:Archon] after
[27:29] >> feel sorry. And and on which
[27:32] >> after failed Shadowfield save
[27:33] >> four wounds. Which one failed? The the
[27:36] third one.
[27:37] >> I thought it was the fourth one.
[27:37] >> The third one. No, hold on. It was a
[27:39] third. You still had one left.
[27:41] >> That's right.
[27:42] >> Shadow field.
[27:42] >> That's right. And then over here
[27:43] shooting. You did kill all the [UNIT:Incubi]
[27:45] with a bunch of bolter shots.
[27:47] >> You did shoot that. Oh, this thing.
[27:49] Yeah. You want to You want to shoot
[27:50] them?
[27:50] >> Yeah.
[27:51] >> A Okay. Well, we'll come back anyway.
[27:52] And then we're going to do some charges
[27:53] and we'll come back after that. Oh, and
[27:55] then these guys absolutely annihilated a
[27:57] unit of uh cabite wars with their twin
[28:00] link sustain two pistol bolter holsters.
[28:04] Uh, so you rolled snake guys into snake
[28:05] guys. Uh, therefore my Dallas lived.
[28:08] Can't change the past.
[28:10] >> Yay.
[28:10] >> Yay. Look at how excited he is.
[28:13] >> This
[28:13] >> I was punished forgetting [UNIT:Plasmancer]. [UNIT:Plasmancer]
[28:15] was sitting in front of me like you
[28:16] forgot.
[28:16] >> You forgot about You painted me. You
[28:18] painstakingly put me together.
[28:21] >> You didn't pay your union deuce. Well,
[28:24] that was not a bad charge. I had
[28:25] forgotten to roll my hazardous. So, we
[28:26] rolled my hazardous before we started
[28:28] fighting. And then you killed all the
[28:29] [UNIT:Rax] and I put four wounds on your
[28:32] [UNIT:Battle Leader] with my [UNIT:Homunculus]. Um, and
[28:35] that [UNIT:Homunculus] got killed by a
[28:36] [UNIT:Thunderwolf Cavalry], but then came back to life
[28:38] with a CP and a couple of pain tokens.
[28:41] Uh, in combat, [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist] failed to kill the
[28:44] [UNIT:Cronos], left the one at one wound. The
[28:46] [UNIT:Cronos] killed the one wounded [UNIT:Terminator Squad]
[28:48] heal back with his pain ability. So,
[28:50] it's back up to four wounds remaining.
[28:53] And with that, we're on to battle round
[28:55] number four. Let's take a look at what
[28:56] you scored. Okay, defense stronghold is
[28:58] something you're on. You finally got
[28:59] assassinate for five points, bring you
[29:01] up to seven. So, we're tied on
[29:03] secondaries. Excellent.
[29:06] And with that, let's dive into the
[29:09] fourth battle round.
[29:10] >> It really ditch a secondary for command.
[29:12] >> I will get another 10. So, I go up to 30
[29:15] uh primary here, which is nice. And uh
[29:18] we do draw some cards. I'm going to pick
[29:20] up my [UNIT:Mandrakes] for a pain token. And
[29:22] I'm going to get that pain token right
[29:23] back away. So, overwhelming force and
[29:26] sabotage.
[29:28] We've been super aggressive this game.
[29:29] Uh, so they moved back. I'm going to get
[29:31] splintered cannon out there. The mandri
[29:33] have dropped down there. Haywire there.
[29:34] Haywire there. Uh, these two flamers
[29:38] here. I'm going to keep that [UNIT:Talos] in
[29:40] combat cuz if I can kill one model with
[29:42] the [UNIT:Cronos], I heal another three wounds.
[29:45] >> Uh, they have a six up save. So, you
[29:47] will be killing them and a single wound
[29:49] each.
[29:50] >> And then we're just going to try to get
[29:51] into here. Fell back. You didn't die to
[29:54] some of the poison stuff. I'm going to
[29:56] try and kill that wolfgar battle lead
[29:57] eater and do as much damage as I can
[29:59] into those [UNIT:Grey Hunters], but it's coming
[30:01] down to the wire. We're committed to the
[30:03] board. You still have [UNIT:Scout Squad] ready to
[30:04] come in as well. So, would you like to
[30:06] [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress] [UNIT:Scout Squad]?
[30:07] >> Uh,
[30:10] no.
[30:10] >> Okay. Well, well, well. They failed to
[30:13] hit and do anything. They did a couple
[30:14] of damage. They didn't do anything. They
[30:16] failed to hit at all. And I didn't do
[30:18] anything.
[30:18] >> Then they wiped out a whole squad of
[30:20] >> No, that was him. That was him. Oh, he
[30:22] was out of combat.
[30:23] >> It was a [UNIT:Cronos]. Just killed all the
[30:24] finish and healed up to full because
[30:25] [UNIT:Cronos] are awesome. I absolutely love
[30:27] that unit of two [UNIT:Cronos].
[30:28] >> Disgusting.
[30:29] >> I'm falling in love with them.
[30:31] >> Charging. Let's go into our Jack's unit
[30:33] with uh them. 8 in. Get out of here.
[30:36] >> They have anti- infantry as well.
[30:37] >> They No, they do not. No, they don't.
[30:39] >> Minus one wound.
[30:40] >> Yeah, whatever. Over here. Nine. Nine.
[30:43] No. No. Uh CP is actually important. No,
[30:46] I don't care about No. Yes, they do. It
[30:47] is very important for me to try to kill
[30:49] you. CP to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll]. Nope. They're going
[30:51] to stay there and die. Oh, I shouldn't
[30:53] have spent my CP there. That's okay.
[30:55] They're going to jump in and they're
[30:56] just going to go nine.
[30:58] >> There's a nine.
[30:58] >> There's a nine right there. It was just
[31:00] the fourth times a charm.
[31:01] >> Yeah, right.
[31:02] >> Why Why would Why wouldn't I do
[31:04] anything? The homocy is going to jump in
[31:06] eight. He's just going to go into that
[31:08] guy. So, if he dies, you can't pile in
[31:10] and fight my [UNIT:Homunculus].
[31:11] >> Right.
[31:11] >> Actually, I'm going to go on this side.
[31:13] Make sure he's within nine of that
[31:14] [UNIT:Terminator Squad]'s brick as well.
[31:16] >> And that's it. Okay, let's do some
[31:18] fights. Okay, end of the turn. I was
[31:20] able to kill your [UNIT:Battle Leader]. Uh I
[31:22] charged in killed almost the whole squad
[31:23] over there and then I killed a couple of
[31:25] the [UNIT:Terminator Squad]. You failed to kill the
[31:27] [UNIT:Cronos] again.
[31:29] >> Again
[31:30] >> again. And uh that's it. So we're going
[31:33] into battle round your battle round
[31:35] four. I did spend a CP for a [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll]. You
[31:36] have still got a CP in the bank. Um
[31:39] however, I'm going to be getting rid of
[31:41] sabotage. I did get an overwhelming four
[31:44] two overwhelming fours. So I do get five
[31:45] points there. going up to 12 secondary
[31:49] points. However, you did successfully
[31:51] defend your stronghold
[31:54] as well.
[31:56] >> And the enemy turn, but that's when you
[31:57] pick him up.
[31:58] >> Correct. Uh, so you go up to 10 points
[32:00] there for defend stronghold. Excellent.
[32:02] Well done. And I am getting rid of
[32:04] sabotage to get a CP because apparently
[32:07] that's how it is. So in your turn, you
[32:08] go up a CP. I go up a CP. And it is
[32:11] battle time. You do have to do a couple
[32:14] of battle shocks around here.
[32:16] Uh, they should be okay with three.
[32:18] >> No, they are not.
[32:20] >> Oh no,
[32:21] >> he's smelly.
[32:23] >> Yes, battle shocked.
[32:26] >> They have to battle shocked as well.
[32:27] Minus one. Oh, they're fine. And then
[32:29] him over there. Minus one. He is
[32:31] battleshocked. He's battleshocked over
[32:33] there. So you have two OC to my 20.
[32:36] >> Three OC.
[32:36] >> He's three. They're not 30.
[32:38] >> They're 30 OC each.
[32:39] >> They're three.
[32:40] >> And everybody says it was each.
[32:42] >> They're 30 each. Oh, you get a 10 points
[32:46] thanks to that as well. Boo. And let's
[32:48] see if you suffer. No. No poison for
[32:52] you.
[32:53] >> No suffrage.
[32:53] >> No. As for cards, you got behind over
[32:55] force after redrawing cull the horde. So
[32:57] behind is good. You got [UNIT:Scout Squad] and
[32:59] you've got your [UNIT:Inceptor Squad] just living
[33:01] large back there as well as overwhelming
[33:03] force. You've got uh [UNIT:Talos]. You've got a
[33:05] [UNIT:Homunculus]. You've got a venom. You've
[33:07] got one two sync little [UNIT:Rax] over there
[33:09] as well that you can use. And couple of
[33:11] [UNIT:Talos] here. Oh, I do have an extra OC.
[33:14] I've got one, two, three, four. Okay.
[33:15] No, but you have three, four, isn't he?
[33:18] Four, five.
[33:19] >> Oh, he's battleshock. Yes. Okay. So, I
[33:21] stop you from getting a 10 cuz I was
[33:22] like, wait, I'm pretty sure. Oh, no.
[33:23] There's a rack there.
[33:24] >> So, you uh get 20. Good. Good. Cuz it's
[33:28] getting close.
[33:29] >> Yes. But three OC on those guys. But too
[33:31] bad you can't bring them in units of
[33:33] five. You have to get units of 10.
[33:35] >> Yeah.
[33:36] >> However, they've been really good. full
[33:37] rerolls in shooting and combat uh
[33:40] against objectives is pretty damn damn
[33:42] good. I'm going to I'm going to say vote
[33:43] for [UNIT:Grey Hunters]. And to be honest, you
[33:46] need to play with
[33:47] >> a slight point drop.
[33:48] >> They do. They do. They're like they need
[33:49] to go up.
[33:50] >> What?
[33:53] I like them.
[33:55] >> Movement wise, we have them move up to
[33:57] engage the [UNIT:Mandrakes]. You did desperate
[33:59] escape and didn't lose any [UNIT:Terminator Squad]
[34:01] to fall back the greyhounders and that
[34:03] fell back as well. [UNIT:Whirlwind] stayed
[34:04] still. They stayed still.
[34:05] >> You didn't have to fall back. You never
[34:06] charged them.
[34:06] >> That's right. as in he stayed still and
[34:08] then over here staying still as well.
[34:10] The [UNIT:Intercessor Squad] started off by killing
[34:11] that hmocus with a volley bolter fire
[34:13] and now we're shooting over here and we
[34:15] will see what happens but it's coming
[34:17] down to the wire. Okay, so shooting
[34:19] phase, the [UNIT:Plasmancer] finally connected and
[34:21] killed one [UNIT:Talos], the nice original
[34:23] [UNIT:Talos], and almost killed the second one,
[34:26] leaving it with one wound remaining. And
[34:27] then over here, you killed seven of the
[34:29] Mandrix with an amazing sustained hits,
[34:32] and I didn't pace any impulse saves. And
[34:35] then the [UNIT:Whirlwind] killed three of this
[34:37] rack unit. And uh they've charged back
[34:39] in to try and kill the [UNIT:Cronos] finally.
[34:42] >> Um
[34:42] >> and then we have some more charges over
[34:43] here.
[34:44] >> Yeah.
[34:44] >> And there we have it. The Mandre
[34:45] survived. Uh, only one died in combat.
[34:48] The [UNIT:Cronos] did die. The [UNIT:Scout Squad] come down
[34:50] over there, of course, cuz they're going
[34:51] to be there. Uh, just shoot them. See if
[34:53] they would have killed that unit. Okay,
[34:55] so you did kill them with the [UNIT:Scout Squad].
[34:57] So, that does give you a full
[34:58] overwhelming force for five points and a
[35:01] full four point behind me. A fantastic
[35:03] secondary turn considering we're playing
[35:05] with like zero secondaries. So, that is
[35:07] five and four. That's nine points there.
[35:09] That's really going to create a bit of a
[35:11] hassle. Very good. So, with that, let's
[35:14] dive into turn number five for the
[35:17] [FACTION:Drukhari]. Um, and I'm going to get a nice
[35:20] 15 points on primary, but for
[35:22] secondaries, we have Kullah Horde, which
[35:24] is a redraw. We're going to go ahead and
[35:26] do Secure No Man's Land, which I get
[35:28] automatically, and engage on all fronts
[35:32] as well. I go up to three, you go up to
[35:35] three, and it is just a fight. So, 45
[35:39] points here. Let's see what we can do as
[35:41] the game comes to a conclusion. Okay,
[35:45] let's go. So, auto pass here uh because
[35:47] the Battleshock failed here. So, I'm
[35:49] going to go into three corners. One,
[35:51] two, three for two points. I'm going to
[35:53] try to get my secure no man's land,
[35:55] which is just how that's going to be.
[35:56] And I'm going to see what I can do with
[35:57] these [UNIT:Terminator Squad] as we basically go to
[35:59] the end of the game. And that is that. I
[36:02] was a unable to kill the [UNIT:Terminator Squad],
[36:03] but I will get secure and a small engage
[36:06] for the end of the game. What a crazy
[36:08] secondary match. So, secure no man's
[36:10] land for five points. Engage for two.
[36:13] That is only seven points. We're up to
[36:16] 19. That is not good. However, we go to
[36:20] your turn. You get a command point. I
[36:22] get a command point as well. Last game.
[36:26] Let's see what you draw. It's going to
[36:27] come down these secondaries. Recover
[36:29] assets. That's going to be five points.
[36:31] Secure No Man's Land.
[36:33] >> Um, could be another five points as
[36:36] well. Battleshocks are going to be big
[36:38] here. So, minus one on the
[36:39] [UNIT:Thunderwolf Cavalry].
[36:40] They are good. So, you're going to get
[36:42] that one there. No problem. Battleshock
[36:44] on our Jack.
[36:45] >> Sorry, these guys.
[36:46] >> On the [UNIT:Grey Hunters], they're good as
[36:47] well. RJ Jack, Rockfist, he's good as
[36:50] well. Nicely done.
[36:51] >> I think that's it.
[36:52] >> That's it. Okay, so as it goes, they've
[36:55] used their CP to advance uh an extra
[36:57] six. So, no grenades there, but you do
[37:00] have them going to do
[37:01] >> assault weapons.
[37:02] >> They do. They can they can they can
[37:04] shoot their guns. Yes. So you go uh
[37:06] recover assets and hold that objective.
[37:07] Recover assets and take my objective
[37:09] down. Recover assets and this is sticky.
[37:11] So you have three zones for recover
[37:13] assets which is going to be five points
[37:16] bring you up to 24 already. You're also
[37:20] going to get a 15 points. There's
[37:23] nothing I can do about that.
[37:26] 35 points on primary. Look at that. Such
[37:30] a crazy game. And last but not least,
[37:33] you have secure no man's end. Right now,
[37:35] you have two. It's all down to can you
[37:38] do this one. So, as it stands, Ben,
[37:42] you're looking at a tie.
[37:43] >> Can I get a line on them with the
[37:44] >> Oh, yes. That's why I moved him this way
[37:46] so you can see them for sure.
[37:48] >> So, if you kill both these [UNIT:Talos],
[37:52] >> it's a tie.
[37:53] >> Okay. So,
[37:54] >> [STRATAGEM:Grenade] first.
[37:55] >> Okay.
[37:56] >> Uh
[37:57] >> on whom? On this. No, you can't [STRATAGEM:Grenade]
[37:58] when you advance.
[37:59] >> Crack [STRATAGEM:Grenade].
[38:00] >> Oh, regular crack. Oh, that might not.
[38:01] No, I don't think that's assault.
[38:03] >> Uh, so just uh 20 shots.
[38:05] >> Uh, well, two of them can't see, but uh,
[38:07] three of them can.
[38:08] >> Okay. Uh, so that's
[38:10] >> Don't forget I got my surge move, which
[38:11] I haven't used all game.
[38:14] >> If you shoot me with boulders, I'm just
[38:15] going to surge into [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist].
[38:16] >> I completely forgot he had they had
[38:18] surge.
[38:18] >> They Yes.
[38:19] >> Um,
[38:20] >> you just have this.
[38:21] >> I just have that.
[38:22] >> That's the biggest thing. And then I
[38:23] surge and then I fight you and then you
[38:25] try fight me back with [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist]. Yeah.
[38:26] Slash jump in. Like if you make that
[38:29] charge as well, it works too, right?
[38:33] >> Uh okay. Yep. Does it wound?
[38:37] >> Uh twos.
[38:38] >> Goes to threes because of the minus one.
[38:40] >> Both wound.
[38:40] >> They both go through. First one does.
[38:43] >> Uh I'm going to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] that.
[38:44] >> Nope. No, I'm just kidding. You
[38:46] absolutely can.
[38:47] >> Is that six damage on one fives? It goes
[38:50] down. Does it explode? No. And the
[38:53] second one is going to do
[38:56] >> seven. Okay. Six, seven,
[39:00] and you do six damage. It has one wound
[39:02] remaining. It is going to surge.
[39:06] Get in. Get into him. So, no more
[39:08] shooting. He has two wounds left. You
[39:10] going to try charge?
[39:11] >> Charge from
[39:11] >> You charge.
[39:13] Yep. They make it. I I don't have enough
[39:15] attacks to stop that from happening. So,
[39:17] that is going to go here. Like so. And
[39:21] that is 74-74.
[39:26] What a great game sir. So with that give
[39:28] you your cards. You will get recover
[39:30] assets as well. So adopty 29. So
[39:34] basically
[39:37] it literally comes down to the fact that
[39:40] it's a 10point difference for primary/
[39:42] secondary. What a crazy game, Ben.
[39:45] >> Awesome. And we're back with a little
[39:47] post action report. Oh
[39:53] >> I like [UNIT:Inceptor Squad].
[39:54] >> Yeah. Yeah. No, they're good. They're
[39:56] good. The [UNIT:Inceptor Squad], yeah, they they did
[39:57] they did a lot of work down.
[39:58] >> First first game I ever run them in. Uh
[40:00] I think I need
[40:01] >> six inch deep strike with It's just so
[40:03] good. Like it's just so good.
[40:04] >> I I think the bolters are the way to go
[40:06] because you're trying to clear that
[40:07] background chaff.
[40:08] >> Of course. That's exactly what they're
[40:09] for. They also kill a venom quite
[40:11] reliably.
[40:12] >> Really?
[40:13] >> Yeah. Because of the twin linked. Like
[40:15] they're actually really good, especially
[40:16] with oath. I really enjoyed the coven.
[40:18] The coven was really fun. I think
[40:20] >> so much poison.
[40:21] >> Six towers was a little too much.
[40:25] What was
[40:25] >> six towers? I Well, I just take two
[40:27] [UNIT:Talos] out and then I put in No, I put in
[40:30] more chaff. I need I need heliens. I
[40:32] need [UNIT:Reavers].
[40:33] >> I need like all the stuff that like
[40:34] helps me play the game.
[40:36] >> So good.
[40:37] >> Reavers are just for that initial
[40:39] skirmish that we had. I had to send out
[40:41] a [UNIT:Raider]. I had to send out like actual
[40:43] things and that didn't make me happy. I
[40:45] need to be able to send out like little
[40:47] trash units early in the game. But other
[40:50] than that, that was really fun, Ben.
[40:51] >> Oh man. Dude, I'm
[40:52] >> Thanks a lot for watching everybody. It
[40:54] was great.
[40:55] >> New codeex, new fun times. Ben's
[40:57] improving slowly but surely.
[40:59] >> Get there. Thanks a lot for watching
[41:00] everybody. Of course, a huge shout out
[41:01] to the channel Patreons and of course to
[41:03] Mini Wargaming. Thanks for letting me
[41:04] use the studio. The links are all down
[41:05] below. I'm going to be going to WCW, so
[41:08] see you there. And uh and then that's
[41:10] the season. That'll be good. Awesome.
[41:12] Thanks all for watching. I've been
[41:14] Scari, your grateful host. This has been
[41:16] Ben signing off until next time. Scari
[41:19] out. Ah, the dark king. Poison, poison,
[41:23] poison, poison, poison, poison, poison,
[41:26] poison.
