[8:22] battle round before the command phase or
[8:22] whatever. I'm going to pick an objective
[8:24] whatever. I'm going to pick an objective
[8:24] for them to be really good on. That's
[8:26] for them to be really good on. That's
[8:26] going to be this one. Eh, might as well.
[8:28] going to be this one. Eh, might as well.
[8:28] Going to get plus one OC. I mean, three
[8:30] Going to get plus one OC. I mean, three
[8:30] OC and the five up invol save on there
[8:32] OC and the five up invol save on there
[8:32] with that unit of hand. As long as I'm
[8:35] with that unit of hand. As long as I'm
[8:35] not battler shocked. Cool. That sounds
[8:36] not battler shocked. Cool. That sounds
[8:36] about right. Um, I'm going to have to
[8:39] about right. Um, I'm going to have to
[8:39] pick my contract. Who shall my contract
[8:42] pick my contract. Who shall my contract
[8:42] be? I say h
[8:46] be? I say h
[8:46] I don't know. Let's put the rose.
[8:51] I don't know. Let's put the rose.
[8:51] Hey, Jean Steelers, will you accept this
[8:53] Hey, Jean Steelers, will you accept this
[8:53] rose?
[8:54] rose?
[8:54] >> We do.
[8:55] >> We do.
[8:55] >> Yes. Heck yeah. That's my first
[8:57] >> Yes. Heck yeah. That's my first
[8:57] contract. Yeah. Yeah. Good job.
[9:01] contract. Yeah. Yeah. Good job.
[9:01] I'm gonna try and get it dead as fast as
[9:03] I'm gonna try and get it dead as fast as
[9:03] possible. I could do lethals on the
[9:05] possible. I could do lethals on the
[9:05] tanks, but I'd like what I like to do is
[9:07] tanks, but I'd like what I like to do is
[9:07] pick a contract like an infiltrator, a
[9:09] pick a contract like an infiltrator, a
[9:09] unit that I that my opponent has to use
[9:11] unit that I that my opponent has to use
[9:11] early, try kill it quick to get an
[9:12] early, try kill it quick to get an
[9:12] influx of pain tokens early in the game
[9:14] influx of pain tokens early in the game
[9:14] to then have access to a lot of the pain
[9:16] to then have access to a lot of the pain
[9:16] abilities later. So, I've got this
[9:18] abilities later. So, I've got this
[9:18] [UNIT:Ravager] that can move up and shoot. I've
[9:20] [UNIT:Ravager] that can move up and shoot. I've
[9:20] got Malice in a position to come out and
[9:21] got Malice in a position to come out and
[9:21] do some damage as well. And I've got um
[9:24] do some damage as well. And I've got um
[9:24] some some venoms that can also get some
[9:26] some some venoms that can also get some
[9:26] angles that way, too. I have to be very
[9:28] angles that way, too. I have to be very
[9:28] careful about this, though. Big angry
[9:30] careful about this, though. Big angry
[9:30] unit of Jean Steelers. Um, so we'll see.
[9:33] unit of Jean Steelers. Um, so we'll see.
[9:33] I can't get too close. So, let's see
[9:36] I can't get too close. So, let's see
[9:36] what cards I get. And my cards. Uh,
[9:38] what cards I get. And my cards. Uh,
[9:38] [OBJECTIVE:bring it down]. Cool. Kill tanks and
[9:41] [OBJECTIVE:bring it down]. Cool. Kill tanks and
[9:41] [OBJECTIVE:recover assets]. Press buttons. Okay.
[9:42] [OBJECTIVE:recover assets]. Press buttons. Okay.
[9:42] Well, press buttons and do stuff. That's
[9:45] Well, press buttons and do stuff. That's
[9:45] something I can live with. End of the
[9:47] something I can live with. End of the
[9:47] movement phase. I know. Very exciting
[9:49] movement phase. I know. Very exciting
[9:50] movement phase. The scourge moved up.
[9:51] movement phase. The scourge moved up.
[9:51] That moved out of a [UNIT:Venom]. And then
[9:53] That moved out of a [UNIT:Venom]. And then
[9:53] they're going to hop back into the
[9:54] they're going to hop back into the
[9:54] [UNIT:[UNIT:Venom]]. This moved out of that [UNIT:[UNIT:Venom]].
[9:56] [UNIT:[UNIT:Venom]]. This moved out of that [UNIT:[UNIT:Venom]].
[9:56] That [UNIT:[UNIT:Venom]] advanced up. This [UNIT:[UNIT:Venom]] that
[9:58] That [UNIT:[UNIT:Venom]] advanced up. This [UNIT:[UNIT:Venom]] that
[9:58] was empty because I dropped them off
[10:00] was empty because I dropped them off
[10:00] moved this way. They're going to shoot
[10:03] moved this way. They're going to shoot
[10:03] potentially there and or here. Then jump
[10:05] potentially there and or here. Then jump
[10:05] back into said [UNIT:Venom] after sticking this
[10:07] back into said [UNIT:Venom] after sticking this
[10:07] objective with that cowboy squad. Then
[10:09] objective with that cowboy squad. Then
[10:09] moved on to that objective which then
[10:11] moved on to that objective which then
[10:11] malice moved up as well to potentially
[10:12] malice moved up as well to potentially
[10:12] charge if I absolutely need to. The
[10:14] charge if I absolutely need to. The
[10:14] [UNIT:cronos] giving a bubble. The dark lance
[10:16] [UNIT:cronos] giving a bubble. The dark lance
[10:16] scourge over there to shoot a rock
[10:18] scourge over there to shoot a rock
[10:18] grinder. And then this [UNIT:Ravager] that
[10:20] grinder. And then this [UNIT:Ravager] that
[10:20] moved up and can see those gene
[10:22] moved up and can see those gene
[10:22] Steelers. Oh my gosh, what a wild ride
[10:25] Steelers. Oh my gosh, what a wild ride
[10:25] that has been. So in terms of doing
[10:26] that has been. So in terms of doing
[10:26] things with uh actions, I can do recover
[10:29] things with uh actions, I can do recover
[10:29] assets with this [UNIT:Venom]. Uh, I could also
[10:31] assets with this [UNIT:Venom]. Uh, I could also
[10:31] do [OBJECTIVE:recover assets] with them. I could do
[10:33] do [OBJECTIVE:recover assets] with them. I could do
[10:33] [OBJECTIVE:recover assets] with the [UNIT:cronos] over
[10:34] [OBJECTIVE:recover assets] with the [UNIT:cronos] over
[10:34] there. So, I'm going to get my three
[10:36] there. So, I'm going to get my three
[10:36] points for recover. Uh, which means I
[10:38] points for recover. Uh, which means I
[10:38] don't have to use them for recover.
[10:40] don't have to use them for recover.
[10:40] They're on this objective to force you
[10:41] They're on this objective to force you
[10:41] to come out this way to play. If you get
[10:43] to come out this way to play. If you get
[10:43] aggressive with the gene sealers, I
[10:45] aggressive with the gene sealers, I
[10:45] they're going to be out in the open
[10:46] they're going to be out in the open
[10:46] here, which then gives me a chance to
[10:47] here, which then gives me a chance to
[10:47] potentially kill them. That is my
[10:49] potentially kill them. That is my
[10:49] contract unit. We're going to do some
[10:51] contract unit. We're going to do some
[10:51] shooting. Ideally, I kill that and do
[10:53] shooting. Ideally, I kill that and do
[10:53] some damage to this, but I can't. And
[10:55] some damage to this, but I can't. And
[10:55] then maybe we'll see what happens to
[10:56] then maybe we'll see what happens to
[10:56] that rock rider since I only have one
[10:58] that rock rider since I only have one
[10:58] pain token. We'll see what happens. I
[11:01] pain token. We'll see what happens. I
[11:01] have one CP. So, this is really what
[11:03] have one CP. So, this is really what
[11:03] this detachment is built around is the
[11:06] this detachment is built around is the
[11:06] ravages with disintegrators. I'm going
[11:07] ravages with disintegrators. I'm going
[11:07] to show you one time what it does and
[11:10] to show you one time what it does and
[11:10] then we're going to go from there
[11:11] then we're going to go from there
[11:11] because it doesn't need pain tokens if
[11:12] because it doesn't need pain tokens if
[11:12] it's shooting a unit that has full
[11:15] it's shooting a unit that has full
[11:15] strength. I'm going to get nine
[11:16] strength. I'm going to get nine
[11:16] disintegrator shots and I'm going to
[11:18] disintegrator shots and I'm going to
[11:18] spend the CP for um tailored toxins. I'm
[11:24] spend the CP for um tailored toxins. I'm
[11:24] going to go down to zero CP. But that
[11:26] going to go down to zero CP. But that
[11:26] means that my sustained hits that I get
[11:28] means that my sustained hits that I get
[11:28] from my contract against infantry will c
[11:31] from my contract against infantry will c
[11:31] uh proc on fives and it gets full rrolls
[11:34] uh proc on fives and it gets full rrolls
[11:34] to hit because of the uh that gene seal
[11:36] to hit because of the uh that gene seal
[11:36] cult unit has full models. So with that,
[11:39] cult unit has full models. So with that,
[11:39] let's see what it looks like. Needing
[11:41] let's see what it looks like. Needing
[11:41] threes to hit with full rerolls and then
[11:43] threes to hit with full rerolls and then
[11:43] sustains on fives. Um I'm just going to
[11:46] sustains on fives. Um I'm just going to
[11:46] [STRATAGEM:command re-roll] it. Sure, why not? Just full
[11:48] [STRATAGEM:command re-roll] it. Sure, why not? Just full
[11:48] rles. Yay. There we go. So we're going
[11:50] rles. Yay. There we go. So we're going
[11:50] to add two more dice there. And then
[11:53] to add two more dice there. And then
[11:53] needing threes to wound, strength six,
[11:54] needing threes to wound, strength six,
[11:54] AP3. So that's going to be eight
[11:58] AP3. So that's going to be eight
[11:58] invulnerable saves against these
[12:00] invulnerable saves against these
[12:00] [UNIT:purestrain genestealers] on a five up in.
[12:03] [UNIT:purestrain genestealers] on a five up in.
[12:03] >> Let's roll it. Oh, they made a decent
[12:06] >> Let's roll it. Oh, they made a decent
[12:06] amount. One is left alive. Well done,
[12:09] amount. One is left alive. Well done,
[12:09] little [UNIT:purestrain genestealers]. Well done. Good
[12:11] little [UNIT:purestrain genestealers]. Well done. Good
[12:11] thing I put extra guns there to shoot at
[12:13] thing I put extra guns there to shoot at
[12:13] them. And then, of course, I did finish
[12:14] them. And then, of course, I did finish
[12:14] them with this unit, this splinter
[12:17] them with this unit, this splinter
[12:17] cannon, because that's why I was on a
[12:19] cannon, because that's why I was on a
[12:19] nice angle there. you know, you made
[12:20] nice angle there. you know, you made
[12:20] some good invul saves, but that's kind
[12:22] some good invul saves, but that's kind
[12:22] of what the [UNIT:Ravager] does. Other
[12:23] of what the [UNIT:Ravager] does. Other
[12:23] shooting, I missed misshot like my order
[12:27] shooting, I missed misshot like my order
[12:27] of operations because you killed the one
[12:28] of operations because you killed the one
[12:28] that I could kind of see with most of my
[12:30] that I could kind of see with most of my
[12:30] stuff, which meant that I only had one
[12:32] stuff, which meant that I only had one
[12:32] dark lance and a spinner cannon that
[12:33] dark lance and a spinner cannon that
[12:33] could shoot there from this unit once
[12:35] could shoot there from this unit once
[12:35] the scourge shot. Nothing crazy. And one
[12:37] the scourge shot. Nothing crazy. And one
[12:37] dark lance from that unit back there.
[12:39] dark lance from that unit back there.
[12:39] Got through that [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] and did
[12:40] Got through that [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] and did
[12:40] eight damage. So, that [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] has
[12:42] eight damage. So, that [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] has
[12:42] two wounds left. So, it is the end of my
[12:45] two wounds left. So, it is the end of my
[12:45] turn. I'm going to get my recover
[12:46] turn. I'm going to get my recover
[12:46] assets. I'm not going to get bring it
[12:48] assets. I'm not going to get bring it
[12:48] down, which means I am likely going to
[12:51] down, which means I am likely going to
[12:51] sit just toss it for a CP. I'm going to
[12:53] sit just toss it for a CP. I'm going to
[12:54] toss it for a CP because I don't want to
[12:55] toss it for a CP because I don't want to
[12:55] have to try and kill anything. Malice is
[12:58] have to try and kill anything. Malice is
[12:58] going to get into the [UNIT:Venom] and then
[13:00] going to get into the [UNIT:Venom] and then
[13:00] both of these units are going to get
[13:01] both of these units are going to get
[13:01] into [UNIT:Venom]. So, I was able to commit and
[13:03] into [UNIT:Venom]. So, I was able to commit and
[13:03] then I'm going to hide. I do have a loan
[13:05] then I'm going to hide. I do have a loan
[13:05] up 18 strategim to try and keep this
[13:07] up 18 strategim to try and keep this
[13:07] [UNIT:Ravager] alive andor that scourge unit
[13:09] [UNIT:Ravager] alive andor that scourge unit
[13:09] alive. There's a whole bunch of cool
[13:11] alive. There's a whole bunch of cool
[13:11] stuff I have. Killing one of the mining
[13:12] stuff I have. Killing one of the mining
[13:12] lasers is good, but putting that rock
[13:14] lasers is good, but putting that rock
[13:14] grinder down to two wounds is probably
[13:16] grinder down to two wounds is probably
[13:16] the best thing other than killing
[13:17] the best thing other than killing
[13:17] gesters, which you put the blip down
[13:19] gesters, which you put the blip down
[13:19] here. You can always deep strike them
[13:20] here. You can always deep strike them
[13:20] next turn and try to get a nice charge
[13:21] next turn and try to get a nice charge
[13:21] and things like that, too. So, with
[13:23] and things like that, too. So, with
[13:23] that, let's dive into uh let's go to the
[13:25] that, let's dive into uh let's go to the
[13:25] scoreboard. With that, I will get three
[13:27] scoreboard. With that, I will get three
[13:27] points for [OBJECTIVE:recover assets] and I will get
[13:30] points for [OBJECTIVE:recover assets] and I will get
[13:30] rid of [OBJECTIVE:bring it down]. Like, I could keep
[13:31] rid of [OBJECTIVE:bring it down]. Like, I could keep
[13:31] it to try and score next turn because
[13:33] it to try and score next turn because
[13:33] it's four points and you have a thing on
[13:34] it's four points and you have a thing on
[13:34] two wounds or whatever. But, you know
[13:36] two wounds or whatever. But, you know
[13:36] what? I'm not going to risk holding on
[13:38] what? I'm not going to risk holding on
[13:38] to a card. I better get a resource early
[13:40] to a card. I better get a resource early
[13:40] in the game that then helps me play the
[13:42] in the game that then helps me play the
[13:42] game. So, with that, we go into the
[13:44] game. So, with that, we go into the
[13:44] turn. You get a command point. I get a
[13:46] turn. You get a command point. I get a
[13:46] command point and you draw cards. I'll
[13:49] command point and you draw cards. I'll
[13:49] get three points there. You're going to
[13:50] get three points there. You're going to
[13:50] get [OBJECTIVE:overwhelming force] and [OBJECTIVE:area denial].
[13:53] get [OBJECTIVE:overwhelming force] and [OBJECTIVE:area denial].
[13:53] Come into the middle of the board and
[13:54] Come into the middle of the board and
[13:54] kill stuff on objectives, which is kind
[13:56] kill stuff on objectives, which is kind
[13:56] of what you wanted to do anyway. So, uh
[13:59] of what you wanted to do anyway. So, uh
[13:59] yeah, take a look at the gen. We'll come
[14:02] yeah, take a look at the gen. We'll come
[14:02] back after the movement phase. We didn't
[14:04] back after the movement phase. We didn't
[14:04] forget the extra CP you did roll and you
[14:06] forget the extra CP you did roll and you
[14:06] rolled a two. So, no extra CP for you.
[14:09] rolled a two. So, no extra CP for you.
[14:09] Should have just gone and stayed home.
[14:11] Should have just gone and stayed home.
[14:11] That's right. On the couch, the lounge.
[14:14] That's right. On the couch, the lounge.
[14:14] >> It's where they're staying next time.
[14:16] >> It's where they're staying next time.
[14:16] >> That's right. That's where they Maybe
[14:17] >> That's right. That's where they Maybe
[14:17] they'll get a CP then.
[14:19] they'll get a CP then.
[14:19] >> Yeah.
[14:20] >> Yeah.
[14:20] >> Um I'm very curious to see what you do
[14:22] >> Um I'm very curious to see what you do
[14:22] because you can get very aggressive and
[14:23] because you can get very aggressive and
[14:23] you have a you did spend the two points
[14:25] you have a you did spend the two points
[14:25] to bring them back. So, now you only
[14:26] to bring them back. So, now you only
[14:26] have eight resurrection points.
[14:28] have eight resurrection points.
[14:28] >> Uh and the management of resurrection
[14:30] >> Uh and the management of resurrection
[14:30] points is an is a very important aspect
[14:32] points is an is a very important aspect
[14:32] because the big units are four, right?
[14:34] because the big units are four, right?
[14:34] No, four, right? Four. Yes. four for the
[14:36] No, four, right? Four. Yes. four for the
[14:36] big ones. So you could like resurrect
[14:38] big ones. So you could like resurrect
[14:38] small units three times like three of
[14:40] small units three times like three of
[14:40] the little units like genene dealers.
[14:42] the little units like genene dealers.
[14:42] This unit is how many? Six. So that's a
[14:44] This unit is how many? Six. So that's a
[14:44] big unit. So if you do a second unit of
[14:47] big unit. So if you do a second unit of
[14:47] five, right? Or you could do this twice
[14:51] five, right? Or you could do this twice
[14:51] once a
[14:52] once a
[14:52] >> and then this none or you could do one
[14:54] >> and then this none or you could do one
[14:54] unit of these, two units of these. So
[14:56] unit of these, two units of these. So
[14:56] it's really going to be I'm very curious
[14:58] it's really going to be I'm very curious
[14:58] to see how you use those points as you
[15:01] to see how you use those points as you
[15:01] move into the uh the turns. And we're
[15:03] move into the uh the turns. And we're
[15:03] back off to the movement phase. So, uh,
[15:05] back off to the movement phase. So, uh,
[15:05] you decide to keep them there. You don't
[15:07] you decide to keep them there. You don't
[15:08] really have to have everything on this
[15:09] really have to have everything on this
[15:09] objective. The big thing of this turn
[15:11] objective. The big thing of this turn
[15:11] was you rolled a one on advance on jeans
[15:13] was you rolled a one on advance on jeans
[15:13] to lose cuz you wanted to kind of get
[15:14] to lose cuz you wanted to kind of get
[15:14] them in this pocket. However, rerolled
[15:17] them in this pocket. However, rerolled
[15:17] it into a one. So, instead of moving
[15:19] it into a one. So, instead of moving
[15:19] them up because you could only get to
[15:20] them up because you could only get to
[15:20] here and be like threatened by like
[15:22] here and be like threatened by like
[15:22] shooting, you decided to just hide them.
[15:24] shooting, you decided to just hide them.
[15:24] That's a smart choice.
[15:25] That's a smart choice.
[15:25] >> Yes.
[15:26] >> Uh, they did deep strike back here,
[15:28] >> Uh, they did deep strike back here,
[15:28] ready to make a charge potentially into
[15:29] ready to make a charge potentially into
[15:29] the [UNIT:Hand of the Archon] over here. And
[15:31] the [UNIT:Hand of the Archon] over here. And
[15:31] then this unit just kind of zoomed up
[15:33] then this unit just kind of zoomed up
[15:33] this way. has a nice little pot shot on
[15:35] this way. has a nice little pot shot on
[15:35] that [UNIT:Venom] back there. Then we have both
[15:36] that [UNIT:Venom] back there. Then we have both
[15:36] of Oh, they're advanced. It advanced.
[15:38] of Oh, they're advanced. It advanced.
[15:38] Okay, so you can't shoot. Then the two
[15:40] Okay, so you can't shoot. Then the two
[15:40] rock grinders are just staging, ready to
[15:42] rock grinders are just staging, ready to
[15:42] hide. You have a saboter on the
[15:44] hide. You have a saboter on the
[15:44] objective and a bunch of [UNIT:Aberrants]
[15:45] objective and a bunch of [UNIT:Aberrants]
[15:45] protecting the [UNIT:reductus saboteur] from potential um
[15:50] protecting the [UNIT:reductus saboteur] from potential um
[15:50] charge. And then the [UNIT:kelermorph] just ran
[15:52] charge. And then the [UNIT:kelermorph] just ran
[15:52] up to get [OBJECTIVE:area denial]. Got a good
[15:54] up to get [OBJECTIVE:area denial]. Got a good
[15:54] advance, a five advance. That's where
[15:56] advance, a five advance. That's where
[15:56] this advance was supposed to go.
[15:58] this advance was supposed to go.
[15:58] >> And then of course you put 60 OC on that
[16:00] >> And then of course you put 60 OC on that
[16:00] objective because I have 60C cabalites
[16:02] objective because I have 60C cabalites
[16:02] back there. you just want to stop me
[16:03] back there. you just want to stop me
[16:03] from getting a 15. You're like, "Nope,
[16:05] from getting a 15. You're like, "Nope,
[16:05] no 15 points for you." And with that, we
[16:08] no 15 points for you." And with that, we
[16:08] go into your shooting phase. Okay, TSN
[16:11] go into your shooting phase. Okay, TSN
[16:11] turning point. This is only the second
[16:12] turning point. This is only the second
[16:12] shooting phase. Um, yeah. So, you gave
[16:14] shooting phase. Um, yeah. So, you gave
[16:14] me five invulnerable saves from last
[16:17] me five invulnerable saves from last
[16:17] cannons because uh you shot the [UNIT:Ravager].
[16:19] cannons because uh you shot the [UNIT:Ravager].
[16:19] I loan up the [UNIT:Ravager] that you
[16:21] I loan up the [UNIT:Ravager] that you
[16:21] redirected into the and then I passed
[16:24] redirected into the and then I passed
[16:24] three out of five. So, there is one
[16:26] three out of five. So, there is one
[16:26] little guy left.
[16:29] little guy left.
[16:29] >> Yeah, good job, little buddy. But uh you
[16:32] >> Yeah, good job, little buddy. But uh you
[16:32] know he's just going to get sabotured to
[16:33] know he's just going to get sabotured to
[16:33] death. So you know whatever you I just
[16:36] death. So you know whatever you I just
[16:36] wanted to show it off. Yeah, good job.
[16:38] wanted to show it off. Yeah, good job.
[16:38] Six up impulse. Ah you did kill him.
[16:41] Six up impulse. Ah you did kill him.
[16:41] Sad. But it is what it is. Uh then you
[16:43] Sad. But it is what it is. Uh then you
[16:43] shot that mortar into those uh scourge
[16:45] shot that mortar into those uh scourge
[16:45] back there and I passed all my saves. So
[16:47] back there and I passed all my saves. So
[16:48] it is what it is. You're not going to do
[16:49] it is what it is. You're not going to do
[16:49] any charges. You have dropped me down to
[16:51] any charges. You have dropped me down to
[16:51] just a single objective in no man's
[16:53] just a single objective in no man's
[16:53] land. But let's go to your scoreboard.
[16:54] land. But let's go to your scoreboard.
[16:54] You will get a three points for
[16:55] You will get a three points for
[16:56] [OBJECTIVE:overwhelming force] and a nice big fat
[16:58] [OBJECTIVE:overwhelming force] and a nice big fat
[16:58] five points for [OBJECTIVE:area denial]. Nicely
[17:00] five points for [OBJECTIVE:area denial]. Nicely
[17:00] done. That is an eight point secondary
[17:03] done. That is an eight point secondary
[17:03] turn as we move into the second battle
[17:06] turn as we move into the second battle
[17:06] round. Um, I get a nice influx of three
[17:10] round. Um, I get a nice influx of three
[17:10] pain tokens for killing my contract plus
[17:12] pain tokens for killing my contract plus
[17:12] one for the turn. So, I get four pain
[17:14] one for the turn. So, I get four pain
[17:14] tokens. And of course, you can use
[17:16] tokens. And of course, you can use
[17:16] strategiums in units that are in
[17:17] strategiums in units that are in
[17:17] strategic reserve. So, my [UNIT:Archon] is
[17:19] strategic reserve. So, my [UNIT:Archon] is
[17:19] going to use his free CP strat oh
[17:23] going to use his free CP strat oh
[17:24] to recontract something. Let me take a
[17:27] to recontract something. Let me take a
[17:27] think. Okay, so I'm still thinking what
[17:29] think. Okay, so I'm still thinking what
[17:29] I'm contracting. But you know what?
[17:31] I'm contracting. But you know what?
[17:31] Let's switch it up. We're going to go
[17:32] Let's switch it up. We're going to go
[17:32] ahead and contract that vehicle unit.
[17:36] ahead and contract that vehicle unit.
[17:36] So now I have lethal hits against
[17:37] So now I have lethal hits against
[17:37] vehicles until I've completed my
[17:39] vehicles until I've completed my
[17:39] contract. So that'll be fun. And with
[17:42] contract. So that'll be fun. And with
[17:42] that, uh, let's see what cards I have. I
[17:44] that, uh, let's see what cards I have. I
[17:44] guess I could draw cards and then do
[17:45] guess I could draw cards and then do
[17:45] that. Call the Horde, which is going to
[17:47] that. Call the Horde, which is going to
[17:47] be a redraw, and [OBJECTIVE:cleanse], which is doing
[17:50] be a redraw, and [OBJECTIVE:cleanse], which is doing
[17:50] actions on objectives. I am going to
[17:53] actions on objectives. I am going to
[17:53] redraw [OBJECTIVE:cull the horde] for Storm. Okay, I
[17:56] redraw [OBJECTIVE:cull the horde] for Storm. Okay, I
[17:56] like this. But uh you only own this
[17:59] like this. But uh you only own this
[17:59] objective,
[18:00] objective,
[18:00] >> but I have a plan for that. So that's
[18:01] >> but I have a plan for that. So that's
[18:01] fine. We're going to probably sacrifice
[18:03] fine. We're going to probably sacrifice
[18:03] my 6-in Deep Strike Scourge to just take
[18:06] my 6-in Deep Strike Scourge to just take
[18:06] that objective away from you and
[18:07] that objective away from you and
[18:08] probably drop a [STRATAGEM:grenade] on that
[18:09] probably drop a [STRATAGEM:grenade] on that
[18:09] Kellamorph or something. I know. We'll
[18:11] Kellamorph or something. I know. We'll
[18:11] see what we do. Uh I did get a command
[18:13] see what we do. Uh I did get a command
[18:13] point. You got a command point. AND I
[18:14] point. You got a command point. AND I
[18:14] GOT A NICE five points on primary as we
[18:17] GOT A NICE five points on primary as we
[18:17] move into my turn number two. Okay,
[18:21] move into my turn number two. Okay,
[18:21] let's uh we have to kill this army like
[18:22] let's uh we have to kill this army like
[18:22] twice. That's kind of how it feels. So
[18:24] twice. That's kind of how it feels. So
[18:24] let's start end of the movement phase.
[18:26] let's start end of the movement phase.
[18:26] Okay, finally got there after a lot of
[18:28] Okay, finally got there after a lot of
[18:28] deliberation. I decided to sacrifice our
[18:32] deliberation. I decided to sacrifice our
[18:32] concepts with the [UNIT:Venom]. Moved up, got
[18:34] concepts with the [UNIT:Venom]. Moved up, got
[18:34] out, keeping everything within 12 or a
[18:37] out, keeping everything within 12 or a
[18:37] setup, right? So I was able to 6-in deep
[18:39] setup, right? So I was able to 6-in deep
[18:40] strike the scourge right on that
[18:41] strike the scourge right on that
[18:41] objective to stop you from holding it
[18:42] objective to stop you from holding it
[18:42] because he's not on the objective. I
[18:44] because he's not on the objective. I
[18:44] decided to sacrifice this [UNIT:Ravager] to get
[18:47] decided to sacrifice this [UNIT:Ravager] to get
[18:47] up aggressive to prevent you from using
[18:49] up aggressive to prevent you from using
[18:49] this space for [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress], but also
[18:51] this space for [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress], but also
[18:51] to potentially shoot down that way if I
[18:52] to potentially shoot down that way if I
[18:52] need or to make sure that I can kill
[18:54] need or to make sure that I can kill
[18:54] them if if anything like going to shoot
[18:57] them if if anything like going to shoot
[18:57] them first, then we'll shoot them or
[18:59] them first, then we'll shoot them or
[18:59] have a [STRATAGEM:[STRATAGEM:grenade]]. I also have a [STRATAGEM:[STRATAGEM:grenade]]
[19:00] have a [STRATAGEM:[STRATAGEM:grenade]]. I also have a [STRATAGEM:[STRATAGEM:grenade]]
[19:00] here in case I need it and a bunch of
[19:02] here in case I need it and a bunch of
[19:02] carbines. I've got a couple of guns
[19:04] carbines. I've got a couple of guns
[19:04] within 12 as well. And I made sure I
[19:07] within 12 as well. And I made sure I
[19:07] didn't finish any movement within nine.
[19:09] didn't finish any movement within nine.
[19:09] Actually, really like the carbines for
[19:10] Actually, really like the carbines for
[19:10] that sort of tactical play where I can
[19:11] that sort of tactical play where I can
[19:11] just drop down. Um, you decided not to
[19:13] just drop down. Um, you decided not to
[19:13] [STRATAGEM:fire overwatch] with the [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] and you
[19:16] [STRATAGEM:fire overwatch] with the [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] and you
[19:16] decided not to [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress] anything
[19:18] decided not to [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress] anything
[19:18] because I did pull the cataly warriors
[19:20] because I did pull the cataly warriors
[19:20] up to push your [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress] back
[19:21] up to push your [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress] back
[19:21] there. Malice to stop you from really
[19:23] there. Malice to stop you from really
[19:23] overwatching or using strategys over
[19:25] overwatching or using strategys over
[19:25] here. So, you're going to see how much
[19:27] here. So, you're going to see how much
[19:27] damage I do in the next turn. You're
[19:28] damage I do in the next turn. You're
[19:28] going to be a lot more aggressive into
[19:30] going to be a lot more aggressive into
[19:30] me. So, I'm very excited to see how this
[19:32] me. So, I'm very excited to see how this
[19:32] goes. Going to do [OBJECTIVE:cleanse] with that
[19:34] goes. Going to do [OBJECTIVE:cleanse] with that
[19:34] [UNIT:cronos]. [OBJECTIVE:cleanse] with that [UNIT:Venom] back
[19:35] [UNIT:cronos]. [OBJECTIVE:cleanse] with that [UNIT:Venom] back
[19:35] there. And uh we're going to do some
[19:37] there. And uh we're going to do some
[19:37] shooting. I'm going to try kill that
[19:38] shooting. I'm going to try kill that
[19:38] unit. I'm going to do [OBJECTIVE:cleanse]. I've got
[19:41] unit. I'm going to do [OBJECTIVE:cleanse]. I've got
[19:41] [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective]. Uh, that's going to be
[19:44] [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective]. Uh, that's going to be
[19:44] No, that's going to I'm not really going
[19:45] No, that's going to I'm not really going
[19:45] to get [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective] because I just
[19:47] to get [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective] because I just
[19:47] contest that objective. I didn't have
[19:48] contest that objective. I didn't have
[19:48] enough space for a second unit.
[19:51] enough space for a second unit.
[19:51] So, it is what it is. Whatever, you
[19:53] So, it is what it is. Whatever, you
[19:53] know. Uh, we might just keep it and for
[19:56] know. Uh, we might just keep it and for
[19:56] next turn cuz that is a nice It's a
[19:58] next turn cuz that is a nice It's a
[19:58] four-point thing. I don't know. We'll
[19:59] four-point thing. I don't know. We'll
[19:59] see. I don't really care. I like CP
[20:01] see. I don't really care. I like CP
[20:01] though. Uh, let's go on to the turn.
[20:03] though. Uh, let's go on to the turn.
[20:03] Shooting phase was QUITE EFFECTIVE. I
[20:05] Shooting phase was QUITE EFFECTIVE. I
[20:05] KILLED MY CONTRACT UNIT. I made them AP
[20:08] KILLED MY CONTRACT UNIT. I made them AP
[20:08] plus one on AP4 dark lances. So the dark
[20:11] plus one on AP4 dark lances. So the dark
[20:11] lances then did lethal hits on fives and
[20:14] lances then did lethal hits on fives and
[20:14] annihilated the unit by themselves. That
[20:16] annihilated the unit by themselves. That
[20:16] was actually pretty cool. Um and then I
[20:18] was actually pretty cool. Um and then I
[20:18] killed a little [UNIT:kelermorph] and I shot
[20:20] killed a little [UNIT:kelermorph] and I shot
[20:20] these two units to death. And I killed
[20:22] these two units to death. And I killed
[20:22] the [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] that had two wounds,
[20:24] the [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] that had two wounds,
[20:24] but they got out and they're fine. Uh
[20:25] but they got out and they're fine. Uh
[20:25] they took a wound from like some
[20:26] they took a wound from like some
[20:26] sporadic shooting. So that's it for my
[20:29] sporadic shooting. So that's it for my
[20:29] shooting phase. I was unable to get uh
[20:31] shooting phase. I was unable to get uh
[20:31] [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective] because I wanted to stop
[20:32] [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective] because I wanted to stop
[20:32] you from getting primary instead of
[20:34] you from getting primary instead of
[20:34] dropping down here potentially. and
[20:36] dropping down here potentially. and
[20:36] getting [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective]. That was a
[20:39] getting [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective]. That was a
[20:39] deliberation that I did there, but it
[20:41] deliberation that I did there, but it
[20:41] means that they're gonna die. I got to
[20:42] means that they're gonna die. I got to
[20:42] use their plus one AP once, which was
[20:45] use their plus one AP once, which was
[20:45] cool to make the dark lances AP4. And
[20:47] cool to make the dark lances AP4. And
[20:47] now I get to hide. So, uh I spent two of
[20:50] now I get to hide. So, uh I spent two of
[20:50] both of my CP. I did a [STRATAGEM:grenade] to try
[20:52] both of my CP. I did a [STRATAGEM:grenade] to try
[20:52] and finish to finish off that tank. And
[20:54] and finish to finish off that tank. And
[20:54] then uh and then shot over here. And
[20:56] then uh and then shot over here. And
[20:56] then I used one on lethal hits. So,
[20:58] then I used one on lethal hits. So,
[20:58] they're going to hop into the [UNIT:Venom].
[20:59] they're going to hop into the [UNIT:Venom].
[20:59] They're going to hop into this [UNIT:Venom].
[21:01] They're going to hop into this [UNIT:Venom].
[21:01] Malice is going to hop into that [UNIT:Venom].
[21:02] Malice is going to hop into that [UNIT:Venom].
[21:02] We're just hiding. We're just still
[21:04] We're just hiding. We're just still
[21:04] hiding. We did bring that [UNIT:Ravager] in, of
[21:06] hiding. We did bring that [UNIT:Ravager] in, of
[21:06] course, and uh he helped shoot a couple
[21:08] course, and uh he helped shoot a couple
[21:08] things. Took a couple wounds off the
[21:11] things. Took a couple wounds off the
[21:11] tank. And that's it. Now the gener is
[21:13] tank. And that's it. Now the gener is
[21:13] going to get involved. Now the aberance
[21:15] going to get involved. Now the aberance
[21:15] are going to get involved. There's a
[21:16] are going to get involved. There's a
[21:16] whole bunch of juicy action going to be
[21:19] whole bunch of juicy action going to be
[21:19] happening. I'm really excited to see how
[21:21] happening. I'm really excited to see how
[21:21] it goes. Let's go to the scoreboard real
[21:22] it goes. Let's go to the scoreboard real
[21:22] quick. I have zero CPs. You kept all
[21:24] quick. I have zero CPs. You kept all
[21:24] your CPS. I will get a fivepoint
[21:26] your CPS. I will get a fivepoint
[21:26] [OBJECTIVE:cleanse]. Very, very nice. So I will go
[21:28] [OBJECTIVE:cleanse]. Very, very nice. So I will go
[21:28] to an eight. Uh it's I'm lagging on the
[21:31] to an eight. Uh it's I'm lagging on the
[21:31] secondaries, but I do have you on
[21:32] secondaries, but I do have you on
[21:32] primaries. I'll drop keep you down at a
[21:35] primaries. I'll drop keep you down at a
[21:35] zero. Um at the I will hold on to storm
[21:38] zero. Um at the I will hold on to storm
[21:38] hostile. It's an easy four points or
[21:41] hostile. It's an easy four points or
[21:41] quote unquote easy
[21:43] quote unquote easy
[21:43] and you will go up to three CP as we go
[21:46] and you will go up to three CP as we go
[21:46] into your turn. And the gene dealers
[21:48] into your turn. And the gene dealers
[21:48] have got [OBJECTIVE:bring it down] and display of
[21:49] have got [OBJECTIVE:bring it down] and display of
[21:49] might. Will they get an extra command
[21:51] might. Will they get an extra command
[21:51] point? We're going to roll it on camera
[21:52] point? We're going to roll it on camera
[21:52] this time because you need to see. Hey,
[21:55] this time because you need to see. Hey,
[21:55] they didn't lounge around this time.
[21:57] they didn't lounge around this time.
[21:57] Hey, the the little uh this guy was
[21:59] Hey, the the little uh this guy was
[21:59] like, "You better you get her done or
[22:01] like, "You better you get her done or
[22:01] else I'm going to eat you and recycle
[22:04] else I'm going to eat you and recycle
[22:04] you into genetical goo.
[22:10] Whatever.
[22:12] Whatever.
[22:12] Movement phase. Aberin's moving forward.
[22:14] Movement phase. Aberin's moving forward.
[22:14] [UNIT:reductus saboteur] staying back. [UNIT:flamers] getting
[22:16] [UNIT:reductus saboteur] staying back. [UNIT:flamers] getting
[22:16] out of the [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] and moving up to
[22:18] out of the [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] and moving up to
[22:18] murder some uh some scourge. The
[22:20] murder some uh some scourge. The
[22:20] genesters made a 3-in advance and
[22:23] genesters made a 3-in advance and
[22:23] they're going to try and just absolutely
[22:24] they're going to try and just absolutely
[22:24] annihilate a [UNIT:Ravager]. Who did [STRATAGEM:fire overwatch]
[22:26] annihilate a [UNIT:Ravager]. Who did [STRATAGEM:fire overwatch]
[22:26] and get four hits by the way uh because
[22:29] and get four hits by the way uh because
[22:29] of the full rerolls to hit, which is
[22:30] of the full rerolls to hit, which is
[22:30] really cool. I love [UNIT:Ravager] for sneaky
[22:32] really cool. I love [UNIT:Ravager] for sneaky
[22:32] overwatches. And if I had infantry
[22:34] overwatches. And if I had infantry
[22:34] sustained, that would have been eight
[22:35] sustained, that would have been eight
[22:36] hits. That would have been crazy. But uh
[22:38] hits. That would have been crazy. But uh
[22:38] you did make some involves. I only
[22:39] you did make some involves. I only
[22:39] killed one. So it is what it is. Uh you
[22:41] killed one. So it is what it is. Uh you
[22:41] did kind of move everything else up.
[22:42] did kind of move everything else up.
[22:42] Your plan was to charge over here and
[22:44] Your plan was to charge over here and
[22:44] then you say a piling consolidate to get
[22:46] then you say a piling consolidate to get
[22:46] onto that objective. But I use my webway
[22:48] onto that objective. But I use my webway
[22:48] all the free [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress] to put a
[22:51] all the free [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress] to put a
[22:51] bunch of OC on that objective so that
[22:53] bunch of OC on that objective so that
[22:54] the plan is now not as easy as you
[22:55] the plan is now not as easy as you
[22:55] thought.
[22:56] thought.
[22:56] >> Now it changes a little bit. And you
[22:58] >> Now it changes a little bit. And you
[22:58] could also kind of do it on this side
[22:59] could also kind of do it on this side
[22:59] like charge here and just go on to that
[23:00] like charge here and just go on to that
[23:00] one. But it just changes the dynamic of
[23:03] one. But it just changes the dynamic of
[23:03] the the where the pieces are on the
[23:05] the the where the pieces are on the
[23:05] board. And I'm okay going there. But if
[23:07] board. And I'm okay going there. But if
[23:07] I go here then you got [UNIT:flamers]. I know.
[23:08] I go here then you got [UNIT:flamers]. I know.
[23:08] It's a bunch of stuff. So So
[23:11] It's a bunch of stuff. So So
[23:11] with that, let's do some shooting. You
[23:13] with that, let's do some shooting. You
[23:13] decide not to bring in reserves. We have
[23:15] decide not to bring in reserves. We have
[23:15] five [UNIT:flamers] and five more [UNIT:Aberrants]
[23:17] five [UNIT:flamers] and five more [UNIT:Aberrants]
[23:17] with an [UNIT:Abominant] in deep strike. And I
[23:20] with an [UNIT:Abominant] in deep strike. And I
[23:20] still have my [UNIT:mandrakes]. I still have uh
[23:22] still have my [UNIT:mandrakes]. I still have uh
[23:22] the [UNIT:reavers]. And of course
[23:24] the [UNIT:reavers]. And of course
[23:24] that, you know, Mandrikes can and will
[23:26] that, you know, Mandrikes can and will
[23:26] next turn probably go up into the sky so
[23:28] next turn probably go up into the sky so
[23:28] I can drop down and do some Mandre
[23:29] I can drop down and do some Mandre
[23:29] goodness. So with that, let's do some uh
[23:32] goodness. So with that, let's do some uh
[23:32] let's do some shooting. Let's see what
[23:33] let's do some shooting. Let's see what
[23:33] happens. You did 14 wounds with [UNIT:flamers]
[23:35] happens. You did 14 wounds with [UNIT:flamers]
[23:36] into the scourge and I passed uh 12. No,
[23:40] into the scourge and I passed uh 12. No,
[23:40] nine saves or what? Anyway, whatever.
[23:41] nine saves or what? Anyway, whatever.
[23:41] Yeah, only three of them died. That was
[23:43] Yeah, only three of them died. That was
[23:43] insane. Um, and now you're going to go
[23:45] insane. Um, and now you're going to go
[23:45] charge. You know what? I'm not even
[23:46] charge. You know what? I'm not even
[23:46] shooting. You show a m a mortar at the
[23:47] shooting. You show a m a mortar at the
[23:48] cab lights and killed one uh against the
[23:49] cab lights and killed one uh against the
[23:49] [UNIT:[UNIT:Archon]], the warlord [UNIT:[UNIT:Archon]] scar. And uh
[23:52] [UNIT:[UNIT:Archon]], the warlord [UNIT:[UNIT:Archon]] scar. And uh
[23:52] you're going to go charge. That's it.
[23:53] you're going to go charge. That's it.
[23:53] You're just going to get involved. I
[23:55] You're just going to get involved. I
[23:55] like it. Big turning point in the charge
[23:57] like it. Big turning point in the charge
[23:57] phase. You did charge. Got an 11 with
[23:58] phase. You did charge. Got an 11 with
[23:58] the [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder]. So you decided to go
[24:00] the [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder]. So you decided to go
[24:00] and contest it with three more OC than
[24:02] and contest it with three more OC than
[24:02] you would have normally because if not,
[24:03] you would have normally because if not,
[24:03] you would have just gone onto the side
[24:04] you would have just gone onto the side
[24:04] there. And then you needed a to roll a
[24:07] there. And then you needed a to roll a
[24:07] nine to get into this [UNIT:Venom] back here.
[24:10] nine to get into this [UNIT:Venom] back here.
[24:10] And you failed and then rerolled it into
[24:12] And you failed and then rerolled it into
[24:12] a snake ice.
[24:12] >> Yep. So that unit decided not to go in.
[24:15] >> Yep. So that unit decided not to go in.
[24:15] Now you could have charged into there to
[24:16] Now you could have charged into there to
[24:16] potentially get around, but it was a
[24:18] potentially get around, but it was a
[24:18] little bit more awkward and you don't
[24:20] little bit more awkward and you don't
[24:20] know if you could have got them all on
[24:21] know if you could have got them all on
[24:21] the objective and you're trying to kill
[24:22] the objective and you're trying to kill
[24:22] a [UNIT:Venom]. So it was like a a calculated
[24:24] a [UNIT:Venom]. So it was like a a calculated
[24:24] risk. It didn't pay off.
[24:25] risk. It didn't pay off.
[24:25] >> Yeah.
[24:25] >> And then over here you are charging here
[24:27] >> And then over here you are charging here
[24:27] and I wonder if this [UNIT:Ravager] will live.
[24:30] and I wonder if this [UNIT:Ravager] will live.
[24:30] Let me know down below. Put [UNIT:Ravager] in
[24:33] Let me know down below. Put [UNIT:Ravager] in
[24:33] the comments. [UNIT:Ravager], yes or no. Does

[24:36] it survive? Okay. I I hope I hope you
[24:40] it survive? Okay. I I hope I hope you
[24:40] put it in the comments. Did the the
[24:41] put it in the comments. Did the the

[24:45] didn't.
[24:47] didn't.
[24:47] And uh he actually exploded.

[25:06] cabalites. There's one remaining, but
[25:07] cabalites. There's one remaining, but
[25:07] didn't kill all of them. That's actually
[25:09] didn't kill all of them. That's actually

[27:48] the way, for anybody who doesn't doesn't
[27:50] the way, for anybody who doesn't doesn't
[27:50] like I recontracted. I did spend my free
[27:52] like I recontracted. I did spend my free
[27:52] strat on the [UNIT:Archon]. Um, and that means
[27:55] strat on the [UNIT:Archon]. Um, and that means
[27:55] I have one CP and you have three CP as
[27:58] I have one CP and you have three CP as
[27:58] well, which means you have a decent
[27:59] well, which means you have a decent
[27:59] amount of CP. You have a free hero
[28:01] amount of CP. You have a free hero
[28:01] convention over here and stuff. I've got

[28:02] a a few reserves to come in as well. So,
[28:04] a a few reserves to come in as well. So,
[28:04] this time we got to use them. End of the
[28:06] this time we got to use them. End of the
[28:06] movement phase, you [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress],
[28:08] movement phase, you [STRATAGEM:rapid ingress],
[28:08] Aberance. So, you have Aberance,
[28:09] Aberance. So, you have Aberance,
[28:09] Aberance, Gene Steelers. I got them out
[28:12] Aberance, Gene Steelers. I got them out
[28:12] of the [UNIT:Venom] and then got all the OC on
[28:14] of the [UNIT:Venom] and then got all the OC on
[28:14] the objective. The [UNIT:Venom] did move up and
[28:17] the objective. The [UNIT:Venom] did move up and
[28:17] uh triggered your savur bomb and you
[28:19] uh triggered your savur bomb and you
[28:19] rolled not a one. So the [UNIT:Venom] died. Uh
[28:23] rolled not a one. So the [UNIT:Venom] died. Uh
[28:23] this unit got out, but they're going to
[28:24] this unit got out, but they're going to
[28:24] pop back into this [UNIT:Venom] to hold my
[28:26] pop back into this [UNIT:Venom] to hold my
[28:26] objective for [OBJECTIVE:defend stronghold]
[28:27] objective for [OBJECTIVE:defend stronghold]
[28:28] potentially. [UNIT:Ravager] can see
[28:31] potentially. [UNIT:Ravager] can see
[28:31] [UNIT:purestrain genestealers]. These mandri dropped down.
[28:33] [UNIT:purestrain genestealers]. These mandri dropped down.
[28:33] They can see a [UNIT:purestrain genestealers]. These
[28:35] They can see a [UNIT:purestrain genestealers]. These
[28:35] scourge have moved up here. They can
[28:37] scourge have moved up here. They can
[28:37] they have targets. Malice got out. The
[28:40] they have targets. Malice got out. The
[28:40] [UNIT:Archon] got out. The [UNIT:Venom] moved around
[28:42] [UNIT:Archon] got out. The [UNIT:Venom] moved around
[28:42] to pick up my [UNIT:Archon] warlord potentially
[28:43] to pick up my [UNIT:Archon] warlord potentially
[28:44] or malice. I'm basically trying to do as
[28:46] or malice. I'm basically trying to do as
[28:46] much damage as I can. Desperate escape
[28:48] much damage as I can. Desperate escape
[28:48] test for that cabite because uh the
[28:50] test for that cabite because uh the
[28:50] that's the the grot grinder test. Passed
[28:52] that's the the grot grinder test. Passed
[28:52] it, moved back, was able to push
[28:54] it, moved back, was able to push
[28:54] basically the rapid ingresses from away
[28:56] basically the rapid ingresses from away
[28:56] from there. So kind of forced you to go
[28:58] from there. So kind of forced you to go
[28:58] onto this location down here. And with
[29:01] onto this location down here. And with
[29:01] that, let's do some shooting. I did put
[29:03] that, let's do some shooting. I did put
[29:03] some mandrix back here to stop you from
[29:04] some mandrix back here to stop you from
[29:04] just teleporting onto this objective in
[29:07] just teleporting onto this objective in
[29:07] your turn. Um and I've got some guns.
[29:10] your turn. Um and I've got some guns.
[29:10] I'm going to try kill. Let's see how
[29:11] I'm going to try kill. Let's see how
[29:11] much I kill. I've got lots of pain
[29:13] much I kill. I've got lots of pain
[29:13] tokens. I've got my abilities still. I
[29:16] tokens. I've got my abilities still. I
[29:16] don't have the scourge, but all the
[29:17] don't have the scourge, but all the
[29:17] vehicles that had high armor are dead
[29:20] vehicles that had high armor are dead
[29:20] except for that one. So, um, and of
[29:22] except for that one. So, um, and of
[29:22] course, this is my contract. So, as soon
[29:24] course, this is my contract. So, as soon
[29:24] as I kill that, uh, the genesters, I get
[29:27] as I kill that, uh, the genesters, I get
[29:27] the contract, which is good. That'll
[29:29] the contract, which is good. That'll
[29:29] give me some more CP. And then I can be
[29:31] give me some more CP. And then I can be
[29:31] very aggressive with my [UNIT:Archon]. If I
[29:33] very aggressive with my [UNIT:Archon]. If I
[29:33] want to recontract something, I can. So,
[29:36] want to recontract something, I can. So,
[29:36] with that shooting phase, end of the
[29:39] with that shooting phase, end of the
[29:39] shooting phase. I did. So much damage
[29:43] shooting phase. I did. So much damage
[29:44] this turn. Let's take a look. I killed a
[29:48] this turn. Let's take a look. I killed a
[29:48] brood lord or a [UNIT:Patriarch].

[29:59] to see if he comes back. I killed that
[29:59] whole unit.
[30:00] whole unit.
[30:00] >> I killed the entire unit of Aberance.
[30:01] >> I killed the entire unit of Aberance.
[30:01] And this [UNIT:Abominant] is at one wound
[30:03] And this [UNIT:Abominant] is at one wound
[30:03] remaining. I did damage. Holy crap. Does
[30:08] remaining. I did damage. Holy crap. Does
[30:08] [UNIT:kabalite warriors] Cartel just do damage? It feels
[30:14] [UNIT:kabalite warriors] Cartel just do damage? It feels
[30:14] different than all the other
[30:16] different than all the other
[30:16] detachments. It's very straightforward.
[30:18] detachments. It's very straightforward.

[30:38] of only because I'm filming is the only
[30:41] of only because I'm filming is the only
[30:41] reason. Well, bye-bye. Okay, that
[30:43] reason. Well, bye-bye. Okay, that
[30:43] doesn't give me another pain token. You
[30:45] doesn't give me another pain token. You
[30:45] have one unit of ominous back here. You

[30:55] unit.
[30:55] >> So, you have two left, which you can
[30:57] >> So, you have two left, which you can
[30:57] then use for one more unit of [UNIT:flamers]
[30:59] then use for one more unit of [UNIT:flamers]
[30:59] for later in the game, which is like a
[31:01] for later in the game, which is like a
[31:01] great way of using it.
[31:02] great way of using it.
[31:02] >> That [UNIT:goliath rockgrinder] went down to two

[31:11] potentially do some work and damage
[31:13] potentially do some work and damage
[31:13] here. So, we'll see what we do there.
[31:15] here. So, we'll see what we do there.
[31:15] And that's about it. Yeah, let's do some

[32:06] [UNIT:Abominant]. What are the odds? Somebody
[32:06] tell me what the odds of that are in the
[32:08] tell me what the odds of that are in the
[32:08] comments. Like mathematically speaking,
[32:11] comments. Like mathematically speaking,
[32:11] please tell me what like like one in
[32:14] please tell me what like like one in

[37:56] >> He did.
[37:58] >> He did.
[37:58] >> Hooray. Finally.
[38:00] >> Hooray. Finally.
[38:00] Finally, he did. He's like, "Ah, and now
[38:02] Finally, he did. He's like, "Ah, and now
[38:02] I'm going to charge you with [UNIT:mandrakes]."
[38:04] I'm going to charge you with [UNIT:mandrakes]."
[38:04] Yay.
[38:08] >> I can take it.
[38:08] >> Get him.
[38:10] >> Get him.
[38:10] In combat, the [UNIT:mandrakes] did a ton of
[38:13] In combat, the [UNIT:mandrakes] did a ton of
[38:13] damage. But this was a feel no pain
[38:15] damage. But this was a feel no pain
[38:15] roll. Look how close he was to
[38:17] roll. Look how close he was to
[38:17] surviving. He just need to make two more
[38:20] surviving. He just need to make two more
[38:20] and he would have lived against the
[38:22] and he would have lived against the
[38:22] Mandre onslaught. But the [UNIT:mandrakes] with
[38:24] Mandre onslaught. But the [UNIT:mandrakes] with
[38:24] their sustained hits and all their
[38:26] their sustained hits and all their
[38:26] shenanigan goodies and the plus one to
[38:29] shenanigan goodies and the plus one to
[38:29] hit in combat thanks to the strategm got
[38:31] hit in combat thanks to the strategm got
[38:31] just so much damage through. Nice. Good
[38:34] just so much damage through. Nice. Good
[38:34] job, [UNIT:mandrakes]. I love my 10 strong
[38:36] job, [UNIT:mandrakes]. I love my 10 strong
[38:36] Mandre unit for that reason is because
[38:38] Mandre unit for that reason is because
[38:38] they do way more damage than you think
[38:40] they do way more damage than you think
[38:40] they should in this detachment. End of
[38:42] they should in this detachment. End of
[38:42] the fight phase. Malice did kill the
[38:44] the fight phase. Malice did kill the
[38:44] [UNIT:reductus saboteur]. Nothing happened over here. And
[38:46] [UNIT:reductus saboteur]. Nothing happened over here. And
[38:46] then you put only two wounds on me with
[38:48] then you put only two wounds on me with
[38:48] the plus one to wound and I killed a
[38:50] the plus one to wound and I killed a
[38:50] whole abery with my little anti-infantry
[38:52] whole abery with my little anti-infantry
[38:52] two plus little whips. But you were able
[38:53] two plus little whips. But you were able
[38:53] to pile in consolidated around to
[38:55] to pile in consolidated around to
[38:55] actually get onto the objective because
[38:56] actually get onto the objective because
[38:56] the [UNIT:cronos] was not and I had decided not
[38:59] the [UNIT:cronos] was not and I had decided not
[38:59] to put Malice on that objective because
[39:01] to put Malice on that objective because
[39:01] I don't want to give you roll wound
[39:03] I don't want to give you roll wound
[39:03] rolls with a bunch of [UNIT:flamers]. So you
[39:05] rolls with a bunch of [UNIT:flamers]. So you
[39:05] all get five points there for that. And
[39:07] all get five points there for that. And
[39:07] then of course this [UNIT:Archon],
[39:09] then of course this [UNIT:Archon],
[39:09] my informant network [UNIT:Archon] is going to
[39:11] my informant network [UNIT:Archon] is going to
[39:11] hide back in this phenom.
[39:14] hide back in this phenom.
[39:14] And it is the next turn. Let's go to the
[39:16] And it is the next turn. Let's go to the
[39:16] scoreboard. Okay, so mark for death. I
[39:19] scoreboard. Okay, so mark for death. I
[39:19] got a big one.
[39:20] got a big one.
[39:20] >> You didn't get your big
[39:21] >> You didn't get your big
[39:21] >> Yay. And [OBJECTIVE:no prisoners]. I got a big one.
[39:23] >> Yay. And [OBJECTIVE:no prisoners]. I got a big one.
[39:23] Yay. 25 points. I had gotten 10 points
[39:27] Yay. 25 points. I had gotten 10 points
[39:27] um for primary. So it's really kind of
[39:30] um for primary. So it's really kind of
[39:30] slid in a very solid direction for the
[39:33] slid in a very solid direction for the
[39:33] Dukari. So with that though, uh you will
[39:35] Dukari. So with that though, uh you will
[39:35] go up, you have two flamer units in
[39:37] go up, you have two flamer units in
[39:37] reserve.
[39:37] >> Yep.
[39:38] >> You go up to four CP. I will go up to a
[39:40] >> You go up to four CP. I will go up to a
[39:40] single CP and you will draw your cards
[39:43] single CP and you will draw your cards
[39:43] which will be [OBJECTIVE:recover assets], press
[39:45] which will be [OBJECTIVE:recover assets], press
[39:45] buttons with units and [OBJECTIVE:cleanse], do
[39:48] buttons with units and [OBJECTIVE:cleanse], do
[39:48] actions with units. Of course, you can
[39:50] actions with units. Of course, you can
[39:50] spend a CP to cycle one of them.
[39:51] spend a CP to cycle one of them.
[39:51] >> Yeah, I will I'll discard uh [OBJECTIVE:cleanse].
[39:54] >> Yeah, I will I'll discard uh [OBJECTIVE:cleanse].
[39:54] >> Yeah, because you have to be on
[39:55] >> Yeah, because you have to be on
[39:55] objectives for that. So, new orders for
[39:58] objectives for that. So, new orders for
[39:58] a [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective] and that is a
[40:01] a [OBJECTIVE:storm hostile objective] and that is a
[40:01] three here. So, you have to take an
[40:02] three here. So, you have to take an
[40:02] objective away from me, which isn't
[40:05] objective away from me, which isn't
[40:05] necessarily too hard. So, with that,
[40:07] necessarily too hard. So, with that,
[40:07] we'll come back after the turn. You
[40:09] we'll come back after the turn. You
[40:09] decided to keep one unit of [UNIT:flamers] on
[40:11] decided to keep one unit of [UNIT:flamers] on
[40:11] the sky because if you can get five
[40:13] the sky because if you can get five
[40:13] points for charging onto an objective or
[40:14] points for charging onto an objective or
[40:14] something, end game, that's great. You
[40:16] something, end game, that's great. You
[40:16] brought them in. You shot the hand of
[40:18] brought them in. You shot the hand of
[40:18] the [UNIT:Archon] to death. This time, the
[40:20] the [UNIT:Archon] to death. This time, the
[40:20] [UNIT:flamers] did do damage. And you put this
[40:23] [UNIT:flamers] did do damage. And you put this
[40:23] 9 in away here. So, you have a 9 in
[40:24] 9 in away here. So, you have a 9 in
[40:24] charge
[40:25] charge
[40:26] >> with a little Do you want to use the Can
[40:27] >> with a little Do you want to use the Can
[40:27] you use the strat to get plus one in the
[40:29] you use the strat to get plus one in the

[40:38] in. Yay. There they go.
[40:38] I be able to jump in there and then
[40:39] I be able to jump in there and then
[40:39] consolidate or pile in like so. Oh,
[40:42] consolidate or pile in like so. Oh,
[40:42] okay. Okay, fair enough. I f I call foul
[40:46] okay. Okay, fair enough. I f I call foul

[40:47] foul on the play.
[40:47] >> Okay.
[40:51] What? What?
[40:55] >> I will say this [UNIT:cronos] f and then healed
[40:58] >> I will say this [UNIT:cronos] f and then healed
[40:58] himself to full and then the only did
[41:01] himself to full and then the only did
[41:01] one more rune to him. Well, uh, and then
[41:03] one more rune to him. Well, uh, and then
[41:03] over here, I had one Mandaring live and
[41:04] over here, I had one Mandaring live and
[41:04] he killed one back and then nothing
[41:05] he killed one back and then nothing
[41:06] happened over there, cuz that's how that
[41:07] happened over there, cuz that's how that
[41:07] works. Let's go to the scoreboard. You
[41:09] works. Let's go to the scoreboard. You
[41:09] get no points.

[41:56] going to go up to 30. Up to 40. So, a
[41:56] respectable 40 points here. And let's
[41:59] respectable 40 points here. And let's
[41:59] see what I get on my cards, which shall
[42:01] see what I get on my cards, which shall
[42:01] be [OBJECTIVE:secure no man's land]. Well, good
[42:04] be [OBJECTIVE:secure no man's land]. Well, good
[42:04] thing I own no man's land.
[42:07] thing I own no man's land.
[42:07] Behind any lines, and I have not been
[42:09] Behind any lines, and I have not been
[42:09] shy about getting aggressive, so that'll
[42:12] shy about getting aggressive, so that'll
[42:12] be a nice uh couple points. Let's see if
[42:14] be a nice uh couple points. Let's see if
[42:14] the only thing you have left at the end
[42:16] the only thing you have left at the end
[42:16] of the game is one unit of [UNIT:flamers].
[42:19] of the game is one unit of [UNIT:flamers].
[42:19] Let's see if we can make that happen.
[42:21] Let's see if we can make that happen.
[42:21] Oh. Oh, and I'm gonna of course use my
[42:23] Oh. Oh, and I'm gonna of course use my
[42:23] free strat to recontract
[42:28] free strat to recontract
[42:28] a rose
[42:29] a rose
[42:29] >> a rose upon you. And I get four more
[42:33] >> a rose upon you. And I get four more
[42:33] pain tokens.
[42:36] So I have so many so many pain tokens.
[42:42] So I have so many so many pain tokens.
[42:42] Uh this makes me so sad. So happy. So
[42:44] Uh this makes me so sad. So happy. So
[42:44] sad. So happy. So happy. End of the moon
[42:46] sad. So happy. So happy. End of the moon
[42:46] phase. And this is a dark eldar table.
[42:50] phase. And this is a dark eldar table.
[42:50] I have screened out like everything.
[42:52] I have screened out like everything.
[42:52] There's no six-inch deep strike. So,
[42:53] There's no six-inch deep strike. So,
[42:53] you've got like a screen with the bikes,
[42:55] you've got like a screen with the bikes,
[42:55] the [UNIT:Ravager], the [UNIT:Venom], these bikes,
[42:57] the [UNIT:Ravager], the [UNIT:Venom], these bikes,
[42:57] this unit of scourge screening over
[42:59] this unit of scourge screening over
[42:59] here. The [UNIT:mandrakes] are pushing up this
[43:01] here. The [UNIT:mandrakes] are pushing up this
[43:01] way. I've decided to commit the the
[43:03] way. I've decided to commit the the
[43:03] fourth [UNIT:[UNIT:Archon]] or the third [UNIT:[UNIT:Archon]].
[43:05] fourth [UNIT:[UNIT:Archon]] or the third [UNIT:[UNIT:Archon]].
[43:05] Malice is ready to charge in over there
[43:06] Malice is ready to charge in over there
[43:06] if I need. [UNIT:cronos] couldn't get onto the
[43:08] if I need. [UNIT:cronos] couldn't get onto the
[43:08] objective. [UNIT:cronos] fell back. Scourge
[43:10] objective. [UNIT:cronos] fell back. Scourge
[43:10] stayed still to use heavy on their dark
[43:12] stayed still to use heavy on their dark
[43:12] lances. So, I basically have the whole
[43:14] lances. So, I basically have the whole
[43:14] you can just kind of like and then this
[43:16] you can just kind of like and then this
[43:16] desperately escaped over here after
[43:18] desperately escaped over here after
[43:18] passing battle shock. So, he's fine. So,
[43:19] passing battle shock. So, he's fine. So,
[43:20] I've pushed your You can go here.
[43:22] I've pushed your You can go here.
[43:22] >> I will.
[43:22] >> And then you can charge me maybe
[43:24] >> And then you can charge me maybe
[43:24] potentially.
[43:25] potentially.
[43:25] >> Perfect.
[43:26] >> Perfect.
[43:26] >> Excellent. And let's see. We have one

[43:29] rose given [UNIT:Aberrants] squad. Um, yeah.
[43:33] rose given [UNIT:Aberrants] squad. Um, yeah.
[43:33] Let's see. Uh, do you think they'll make
[43:35] Let's see. Uh, do you think they'll make
[43:35] all their Filmo paints? I vote. It's
[43:38] all their Filmo paints? I vote. It's
[43:38] about time they do. And that's it. I
[43:41] about time they do. And that's it. I
[43:41] killed them. The dark lances got five
[43:43] killed them. The dark lances got five
[43:43] sustain five wounds through because
[43:45] sustain five wounds through because
[43:45] sustained hit dark lances are awesome.
[43:47] sustained hit dark lances are awesome.
[43:47] And they uh shot and killed the uh you
[43:50] And they uh shot and killed the uh you
[43:50] actually made like eight out of 10
[43:54] actually made like eight out of 10
[43:54] >> saves at six ups. You rolled eight sixes
[43:57] >> saves at six ups. You rolled eight sixes
[43:57] and failed two or like something like
[43:59] and failed two or like something like
[43:59] that. So one lived. It was crazy. It was
[44:01] that. So one lived. It was crazy. It was
[44:01] awesome. Okay, let's uh see what you
[44:03] awesome. Okay, let's uh see what you
[44:03] get. So I'm going to get [OBJECTIVE:secure no man's land]'s
[44:04] get. So I'm going to get [OBJECTIVE:secure no man's land]'s
[44:04] land and [OBJECTIVE:behind enemy lines]. That is a
[44:06] land and [OBJECTIVE:behind enemy lines]. That is a
[44:06] nice round total of nine more points
[44:09] nice round total of nine more points
[44:09] bringing up to 34. A very healthy game
[44:13] bringing up to 34. A very healthy game
[44:13] from the Dukari over here. Let's see
[44:15] from the Dukari over here. Let's see
[44:15] what you can draw. As we go into the
[44:18] what you can draw. As we go into the
[44:18] last turn, you will draw extend battle
[44:20] last turn, you will draw extend battle
[44:20] lines. No.
[44:21] lines. No.
[44:21] >> And you'll extend do [OBJECTIVE:sabotage], which
[44:24] >> And you'll extend do [OBJECTIVE:sabotage], which
[44:24] will be n impossible. Which one would
[44:27] will be n impossible. Which one would
[44:27] you like to get rid of?
[44:28] you like to get rid of?
[44:28] >> [OBJECTIVE:sabotage].
[44:29] >> [OBJECTIVE:sabotage].
[44:29] >> Yep, that makes sense. Try and get
[44:31] >> Yep, that makes sense. Try and get
[44:31] something else.
[44:32] something else.
[44:32] >> Attempting target.
[44:32] >> Attempting target, which I'm going to
[44:35] >> Attempting target, which I'm going to
[44:35] pick that one.
[44:36] pick that one.
[44:36] >> Oh, no.
[44:39] >> Oh, no.
[44:39] >> I can make it there.
[44:41] >> I can make it there.
[44:41] >> Yes.
[44:42] >> Yes.
[44:42] If I can hope, I can dream.
[44:44] If I can hope, I can dream.
[44:44] >> Where there's a will, is a way.

[44:45] >> Where there's a will. There is a way.
[44:48] >> Where there's a will. There is a way.
[44:48] So, with that, they would uh come down
[44:50] So, with that, they would uh come down
[44:50] over here potentially or potentially
[44:52] over here potentially or potentially
[44:52] over there and charge. And even with a
[44:54] over there and charge. And even with a
[44:54] 6-in pile and consolidate, they can't
[44:55] 6-in pile and consolidate, they can't
[44:55] really get to any of the objectives
[44:56] really get to any of the objectives
[44:56] because I was able to screen out the
[44:58] because I was able to screen out the
[44:58] board. So, with that, we shall call it a
[45:02] board. So, with that, we shall call it a
[45:02] game. That is a 39 to a 40 uh 84.
[45:09] game. That is a 39 to a 40 uh 84.
[45:09] >> Course.
[45:09] >> So, it's Well, you got points though. I
[45:11] >> So, it's Well, you got points though. I
[45:11] think that's uh 18-2 or 19-1. That's you
[45:13] think that's uh 18-2 or 19-1. That's you
[45:13] got points. You got you did get points
[45:15] got points. You got you did get points
[45:15] even though that was bad. You fought
[45:17] even though that was bad. You fought
[45:17] tooth to nail till the end. Fantastic
[45:19] tooth to nail till the end. Fantastic
[45:19] game. Thank you so much for coming down.
[45:21] game. Thank you so much for coming down.
[45:21] It was a
[45:22] It was a
[45:22] >> wild game. I feel that the game would be
[45:25] >> wild game. I feel that the game would be
[45:25] different if I lose the role to put my
[45:27] different if I lose the role to put my
[45:27] man drinks down and if I lose the role
[45:29] man drinks down and if I lose the role
[45:29] to go first, especially if you would
[45:31] to go first, especially if you would
[45:31] have like committed and been like, you
[45:32] have like committed and been like, you
[45:32] know what, I know how this game goes if
[45:34] know what, I know how this game goes if
[45:34] I go second anyway. So, I might as well
[45:36] I go second anyway. So, I might as well
[45:36] bank on trying to go first and then just
[45:38] bank on trying to go first and then just
[45:38] kind of like frontload everything and go
[45:40] kind of like frontload everything and go
[45:40] for the role if you're playing in a team
[45:42] for the role if you're playing in a team
[45:42] because you and I play a lot of team
[45:43] because you and I play a lot of team
[45:43] events.
