[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] From the days of the heresy, an ancient
[0:06] feud has burned.
[0:08] The [FACTION:Space Wolves],
[0:10] the [FACTION:Space Wolves], marched to war with
[0:14] hatred for the [FACTION:Thousand Sons], written
[0:16] into every saga.
[0:19] Forged in fury and bound by the oaths of
[0:22] vengeance, they carry the wrath of Fenis
[0:25] into battle. Determined to bring ruin to
[0:29] their most bitter foe. But the thousand
[0:32] sons stand ready. Cursed by their own
[0:36] sorcery, yet empowered by the will of
[0:39] Zech. It is fang against flame, saga
[0:44] against sorcery. The [FACTION:Space Wolves] face
[0:47] the [FACTION:Thousand Sons], and eternal rivals
[0:51] will clash once more.
[0:54] [Music]
[1:03] It's time for the [FACTION:Space Wolves], baby.
[1:05] It's the first time. We're running 2,000
[1:07] points. Fletcher has been beavering away
[1:09] like a little wolf in the background.
[1:12] We've added in a couple of lamb raiders
[1:13] to the army, and we're finally at 2,000
[1:15] points. Technically, it's 2005, but both
[1:18] me and Katie are at 20,05 points, and we
[1:20] agreed that this would be very
[1:21] acceptable. So, we're taking all the
[1:22] stuff that we possibly can. This list is
[1:25] being led by none other than big boy
[1:27] himself, Logan Grimnau. He is going to
[1:30] be leading a unit of five Wolfguard
[1:33] [UNIT:Terminator Squad]. Speaking of [UNIT:Terminator Squad],
[1:35] I'm also running [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist] who has
[1:37] his own unit of five [UNIT:Terminator Squad] and
[1:40] they will be deep striking later on.
[1:41] [UNIT:Ragnar Blackmane] Black Mane is here as well. He is
[1:44] going to be joining a unit of 20 blood
[1:46] claws. So, a nice big blob of [FACTION:Space Wolves] boys
[1:49] over there. I have a [UNIT:Wolf Guard [Legends]] battle
[1:52] leader who I've equipped with a thunder
[1:54] hammer and storm shield. You have to
[1:56] imagine his sword is very powerful and
[1:58] has the power of a thunder hammer. Um
[2:00] and yes, he's going to be joining a unit
[2:01] of six [UNIT:Wolf Guard Terminators] with
[2:03] mastercraft of power weapons and storm
[2:06] shields. They are going to be
[2:08] transported into battle by their very
[2:09] own lamb raider. It looks absolutely
[2:12] beautiful, doesn't it? What a lovely job
[2:13] Fletcher has done. My second lamb raider
[2:16] in this list is going to be transporting
[2:18] a unit of five [UNIT:Wulfen] with storm shield.
[2:21] I wanted to keep these nice and safe so
[2:23] they will be charging out of its
[2:24] mechanical more later on in the game.
[2:27] And then finally I'm taking a wolf
[2:30] priest. I've given him the wolf touched
[2:32] enhancement as I'm running Saga of the
[2:34] beast slayer and he's going to be
[2:35] joining a unit of 10 [UNIT:Wulfen] with storm
[2:37] shields. So he becomes much faster, can
[2:40] lead the wolfen, can bring them back to
[2:42] life. So, that should be a very
[2:43] terrifying prospect for the prosperian
[2:47] foe I'm facing today. So, let us see
[2:50] what those wicked wyches are conjuring
[2:53] up as the [FACTION:Thousand Sons] march towards my
[2:56] [UNIT:Wulfen] form.
[3:00] [Music]
[3:06] Space wizards. Yes, what better way to
[3:09] deal with disgusting pests than with
[3:12] overpowered magic. And speaking of
[3:15] overpowered magic, I am of course taking
[3:17] the grand coven with these [FACTION:Thousand Sons]
[3:18] today. And at the head of it is [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red
[3:21] the Red because I can't help myself.
[3:24] He's just so cool. Uh, as this is a
[3:27] thousand sun list, we do have a plethora
[3:29] of characters, including an exalted
[3:32] [UNIT:Sorcerer] leading a squad of 10 [UNIT:Rubric Marines]
[3:34] and an [UNIT:Exalted Sorcerer] on disc leading
[3:37] a squad of 10 [UNIT:Rubric Marines] with the [UNIT:Flamers]
[3:39] for my flamery bomb. I do also have a
[3:42] [UNIT:Sorcerer] in terminator armor leading 10
[3:45] [UNIT:Scarab Occult Terminators]. And I have a
[3:48] [UNIT:Tzaangor Shaman] leading three enlightened
[3:50] [UNIT:Tzaangors] with their great bows because
[3:53] they're just great.
[3:56] I do then have two units of 10 [UNIT:Tzaangors] on
[3:59] foot just because I do apparently need
[4:02] some sacrificial chaos space marines in this magical
[4:05] army and because I can't help myself. I
[4:07] just love them so much. Two mutilith
[4:09] vortex beasts which does bring the list
[4:12] up to 2005 points. But as Beard pointed
[4:15] out, we have made an agreement. We are
[4:17] both at the exact same amount of points.
[4:19] Therefore, we should be equally powered.
[4:21] Except we won't be because I have the
[4:23] power of magic at my side.
[4:31] [Music]
[4:40] >> It's the wolf time.
[4:42] >> Or is it the wizard time?
[4:43] >> Ah, could be. Why not both?
[4:45] >> Yeah, wolf wizards.
[4:46] >> Yeah, I mean it's an ancient rivalry.
[4:49] Why will we we ignited one more time
[4:52] between the [FACTION:Space Wolves] and the
[4:54] [FACTION:Thousand Sons]?
[4:55] >> Always actually seems quite fitting for
[4:56] the [FACTION:Space Wolves].
[4:57] >> Yeah.
[4:58] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it.
[4:59] Um lovely to have a full 2,000 point
[5:02] army finally in this lovely scheme. 30th
[5:06] Company have finally returned. We have
[5:07] two new land raiders. In here are some
[5:10] friends. We have [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist] and his
[5:12] five [UNIT:Terminator Squad]. Over here, Wolfgar
[5:15] Bass Leader and his six headtakers. And
[5:18] I also have nothing else.
[5:21] >> I think that
[5:22] >> you have your Deep Strike.
[5:23] >> Oh, yes. Logan [UNIT:Logan Grimnar] coming in
[5:27] from Deep Strike uh later on, but
[5:29] probably quite early on because of his
[5:31] because of his rule.
[5:32] >> That does stress me out. Uh I do have 10
[5:34] [UNIT:Scarab Occult Terminators] with their
[5:35] Scarabult Terminator [UNIT:Sorcerer]. Excellent
[5:37] in Deep Strike.
[5:38] >> Yes. Well, uh whilst you're here, uh if
[5:41] your first time here, hello. If you've
[5:42] been here before, um if you could just

[7:17] >> My turn.
[7:18] >> Okay.
[7:18] >> I'm quite happy with my draw. I magicked
[7:20] it. You see?
[7:21] >> Clever.
[7:21] >> Communed with the gods. Uh I've secured
[7:23] no man's land extend battle. Excellent.
[7:25] >> Well, I've already scouted my chaos space marines uh 6
[7:27] in forward to move towards that
[7:28] objective. So I should be able to do
[7:30] quite well on those.
[7:31] >> Yeah.
[7:31] >> Yay. I'm also gonna spend a command
[7:33] point on desecration of worlds. Uh, so I
[7:37] keep make this objective sticky.
[7:38] >> Well, how nice for you.
[7:39] >> So, I have no command points, but I do
[7:41] have a dream.
[7:42] >> A desecrated dream.
[7:44] >> For the first bit of movement, these
[7:46] chaos space marines are going to move forward and
[7:47] storm the objective for me. Just turning
[7:50] into it gracefully, as all chaos space marines are.
[7:54] Well, not so graceful. Next, the Misha
[7:56] Vortex Murro bravely is going to leap
[7:58] upon this building to be within range of
[8:00] the objective. and to be very scary.
[8:04] Then the corner of death over here, the
[8:06] mutual vortex beast is going to move up
[8:08] and round just behind the [UNIT:Tzaangors]. The
[8:11] [UNIT:Flamers] are going to tuck just next to
[8:13] him. And then [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red, who does have his
[8:16] impossible form active, is just going to
[8:19] step behind.
[8:21] Roll. Okay, your turn. I'm trying to
[8:24] lure you in.
[8:25] >> However, good old muty over there is
[8:28] going to shoot you with my beam of warp
[8:29] vortex. Oh,
[8:30] >> your land raider to be precise.
[8:32] >> Oh, no.
[8:32] >> You'll be pleased to know it's only got
[8:34] one shot.
[8:34] >> I am pleased to know
[8:36] >> it hits.
[8:37] >> I'm not pleased to see that.
[8:38] >> It's going to be three sto.
[8:39] >> Okay.
[8:42] >> Don't mind seeing
[8:43] >> that's my turn.
[8:46] Well, uh I get five for landl for those
[8:48] two and I get four for extend metal
[8:50] lines cuz I've extended them.
[8:51] >> Nice. Just my turn.
[8:57] >> It is turn one for the [FACTION:Space Wolves]. I
[9:00] have drawn bring it down and engage on
[9:02] all fronts
[9:04] >> which are okay can come down turn one
[9:06] with loan so that will help engage on
[9:08] all fronts
[9:09] >> I'm going to put oath moment on that
[9:11] there new to left vortex beast because I
[9:13] want to kill it and I want it's
[9:14] objective
[9:15] >> I understand
[9:15] >> so that that that is that is the plan
[9:17] this is a very scary corner don't really
[9:19] know what to do about that uh but
[9:22] >> I have I have two wolves in me both of
[9:24] them want to charge
[9:26] the movement phase begins the lamb
[9:29] raider is going to make its way forward
[9:31] over like this. It's gaping more opens
[9:34] because Fletcher was very kind and did
[9:36] the door for me. And the [UNIT:Wolf Guard [Legends]] and
[9:40] Arjac emerge and they go, "Oh." The
[9:44] [UNIT:Wulfen] with their storm shields and
[9:45] thunder hammers and my [UNIT:Wolf Priest] move
[9:48] up. We're moving normally. Make our way
[9:50] up the building over here so we can at
[9:51] least get some frags [STRATAGEM:Grenade] launchers,
[9:55] auto launchers in range. Hopefully they
[9:58] won't get [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red. Next up, we have the
[10:00] [UNIT:Blood Claws]. Unfortunately, I got a very
[10:02] low roll on the advance, so I'm going to
[10:04] make use of some of the terrain here.
[10:05] Going to be difficult to hide a blob of
[10:07] 20, but at least I should be able to get
[10:10] some cover. Last bit of normal movement.
[10:11] The Land Raider over here is going to
[10:13] make its way forwards, squeezing in.
[10:16] He's not quite this far forward, but I
[10:17] don't want to scratch anything. Uh, into
[10:19] this gap over here. And the last part of
[10:21] the movement phase. is [UNIT:Logan Grimnar] and
[10:22] his [UNIT:Wolf Guard Terminators] arrive
[10:25] fresh for battle and Fletcher's in the
[10:28] room looking at his face.
[10:32] >> It's the shooting phase. Prepare
[10:34] yourself and demon
[10:36] >> hide.
[10:38] The vortex mut beast is hiding under a
[10:40] building.
[10:43] >> Um I'm going to shoot everything from
[10:44] this here lamb rail into that there.
[10:46] Mortal mutex beast. Mutil.
[10:49] >> Sure. I am a legendary slayer, so I get
[10:51] lethal hits against
[10:52] >> slay. Cool.
[10:53] >> I I will do my best. I've hit you all
[10:54] the times and it is lethal hit and it's
[10:56] a sustained.
[10:57] >> Cool.
[10:57] >> Yeah.
[10:57] >> So, one auto hits.
[10:59] >> Yes,
[11:00] >> please.
[11:00] >> Can I wound you? Uh, I wound you once
[11:02] with my lethal hit.
[11:03] >> Once with what's auto on a bolter
[11:05] >> storm heavy minus one.
[11:07] >> Minus one minus nothing. So,
[11:08] >> you're in cover.
[11:09] >> I cannot.
[11:10] >> You don't care. My multi.
[11:12] >> Here we go. Double hit. Melt, you beast.
[11:17] One wound minus four. Five up in
[11:19] vulnerable save. No. What's the damage?
[11:22] >> Six.
[11:23] >> Two.
[11:24] >> Is it?
[11:26] >> No.
[11:26] >> No. Nothing.
[11:28] >> Five. No pain.
[11:30] >> Right. My
[11:32] godammer laz cannon.
[11:34] >> Face my godly wrath. You beast.
[11:37] >> Well, that is lethal.
[11:38] >> One lethal. I'll be wounding you on your
[11:41] toughness.
[11:42] >> 10.
[11:45] >> Yes. Four wounds. AP2. Eat my laz.
[11:50] >> Five up. Invulnerable saves. Oh, that's
[11:53] not good.
[11:53] >> That's not good.
[11:54] >> What's the damage on these?
[11:55] >> D6 plus one, baby.
[11:56] >> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to
[11:58] think. I need a second to think. I'm
[11:59] going to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] one.
[12:00] >> You're going to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] a CP [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll].
[12:02] >> I love him.
[12:03] >> Okay. You don't love them that much.
[12:06] >> No.
[12:06] >> Here we go. The damage.
[12:08] >> Jim Crickets.
[12:10] >> 1 2 3 4. Sorry. I can do this. I can do
[12:12] this. I believe in myself. 5 6 7 8 9 10

[12:19] >> 16 17 18 19
[12:21] >> plus four
[12:23] >> 20 21 22 23 That's right. I only need to
[12:26] get 11
[12:30] 12 five ups.
[12:31] >> Okay, good luck to you.
[12:35] It was a good effort.
[12:38] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14.
[12:45] >> So close.
[12:46] >> I really just did it.
[12:47] >> My hunter killer missile fires into the
[12:49] sky and a big wolf firework is
[12:52] exploding. Oh my Logan's now in the
[12:55] wrong place.
[12:58] The mighty guns of the Lamraider on this
[13:00] flank have opened fire into the other
[13:02] [UNIT:Mutalith Vortex Beast], doing six wounds
[13:05] this time. Not as much as previously,
[13:07] but there were some very, very good feel
[13:09] no pain saves made by the wizard KT.
[13:14] Just the one charge to do. The Wolfguard
[13:16] [UNIT:Terminator Squad] and [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist] charge headlong
[13:19] needing a four luckily into the [UNIT:Tzaangors]
[13:22] over here. We must cleave their hooves
[13:24] from their legs and take their
[13:27] objective. Quick fight phase. [UNIT:Wolf Guard [Legends]]
[13:30] [UNIT:Terminator Squad].
[13:31] >> My chaos space marines are going to be fine. They're
[13:33] mastercrafted power weapons. Masty
[13:36] crafty. Masty crafty. Many missy.
[13:39] >> Hell yeah.
[13:40] >> Many missy.
[13:41] >> It's cuz I'm the goat.
[13:43] >> Good grief. Uh, no rerolls. No uh sagas
[13:46] just yet.
[13:48] >> Your toughness, please. Toughness four.
[13:50] That is all the wounds. Five, six,
[13:53] seven.
[13:53] >> Seven, you say?
[13:54] >> Seven wounds.
[13:55] >> Seven.
[13:57] >> Well, that's seven dead.
[13:58] >> Seven dead. Lovely. Three left. the uh
[14:00] relic great axe. It's great.
[14:07] >> Uh not that great.
[14:09] >> Nope.
[14:10] >> Not that great.
[14:11] >> Nope.
[14:11] >> Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Uh and then
[14:13] we'll get we have RJ Jack.
[14:15] >> I was going to say I can't survive this.
[14:16] >> Hopefully he'll finish them off. Come
[14:18] on, RJ Jack. Oh, here we go.
[14:21] >> Yeah.
[14:21] >> Come on, RJ.
[14:23] >> Give him some of the business, RJ. Ah,
[14:25] here we go. That is f there.
[14:29] Oh,
[14:29] >> stop spinning you stupid dice. It's a
[14:32] wound. Yeah.
[14:33] >> Uh, five wounds, please.
[14:34] >> Five wounds. I've only got three left.
[14:35] >> Okay.
[14:37] I've got none left.
[14:39] >> You see, the reason they missed is cuz
[14:40] RJ Jack barged them out the way so he
[14:42] could hammer them himself.
[14:43] >> Yeah.
[14:43] >> Hammer time.
[14:45] Boom. That is the end of my turn.
[14:48] >> Is it?
[14:48] >> It was reasonably good. I was It's a bit
[14:51] full. I mean, I wasn't expecting to
[14:53] completely kill the mortal. Can't say
[14:56] it. the vortex beast for my lam raider.
[14:58] I wanted to charge him with Logan and
[15:00] get um engage,
[15:02] >> but sadly I did not. Um so with that in
[15:05] mind, I got one point for engage. I got
[15:07] four for bring it down. I've got one on
[15:09] my beast slayer tally. Um and now these
[15:13] [UNIT:Terminator Squad] must hold the thin line.
[15:15] >> Uh I did also pick up my Zangors that
[15:17] were on my home objective with the
[15:19] ambushing hunters ability.
[15:20] >> Nice.
[15:25] >> Turn two. I'm only going to get three
[15:27] three on the primary for this one down
[15:28] here. Okay.
[15:29] >> But I have a plan.
[15:31] >> I've got storm hostile objective and
[15:32] assassination.
[15:33] >> Excellent.
[15:33] >> Both of which I very much want to do
[15:35] this turn. Uh because you have so many
[15:37] invulnerable saves. Uh I'm going to use
[15:39] Wrath of the Immaterium to give all of
[15:41] my psychic weapons devastating.
[15:43] >> How unpleasant.
[15:44] >> Yeah, hopefully it should be very very
[15:45] unpleasant for you. And I'm also once
[15:47] again going to do the impossible form
[15:49] for [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red. So you don't kill him next
[15:51] time cuz I like him.
[15:55] movement phase and it is the turn to be
[15:57] aggressive. We will cage you for one
[15:58] turn and that's about all that I can
[16:00] muster. So, he's going to come up to
[16:02] here. My [UNIT:Rubric Marines] are going to
[16:04] move just so all of my [UNIT:Flamers] are
[16:06] within range of those [UNIT:Terminator Squad]. And
[16:08] then [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red is going to move around for
[16:10] some different targets. I think I might
[16:12] try and put him into the [UNIT:Wulfen]. I don't
[16:14] know if that's a good idea or not. We're
[16:15] going to find out. Let's go [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[16:20] The exalted [UNIT:Tzaangors] are going to just fly
[16:22] up to here with their great bows. best
[16:25] snipers in the game. You cannot disagree
[16:27] with me.
[16:34] >> It is the start of the shooting phase or
[16:35] also known as the quasi uh psychic
[16:38] phase,
[16:39] >> magic missiles.
[16:39] >> I've already done some of my Cabal
[16:42] tests. I have temporarily surged my
[16:44] [UNIT:Terminator Squad] so they're all a bit closer
[16:46] so they can all see the [UNIT:Wulfen].
[16:48] >> My shaman here has put Destiny's Ruin
[16:50] onto those Wolfins so I get to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll]
[16:52] ones to hit against them.
[16:54] And uh I I have twisted or fated your
[16:57] [UNIT:Terminator Squad] for from [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[17:01] >> I I got it for the extra 2 AP, but I
[17:03] also did do a mortal wound onto [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[17:05] >> He is now going to attempt to doom bolt
[17:07] your [UNIT:Wulfen].
[17:08] >> Oh no.
[17:09] >> Doomy bolt.
[17:09] >> Poor old [UNIT:Wulfen].
[17:11] >> Uh four, five, six, seven, eight. Do I
[17:15] want to push it?
[17:16] >> I do.
[17:17] >> Why not?
[17:19] >> No.
[17:20] >> Mortal wounds though. Yeah, but you take
[17:22] D3 mortal wounds.
[17:24] >> D3.
[17:26] An eye for an eye. A wolf and tooth for
[17:28] a prosperine hoof.
[17:31] >> All right, I'm going to shoot them lots
[17:32] and lots and lots and lots.
[17:33] >> Actual shooting face. Now I'm going to
[17:35] start with the [UNIT:Mutalith Vortex Beast]
[17:37] whose mutating vortex did absolutely
[17:38] nothing. I rolled a one.
[17:40] >> Nice.
[17:40] >> However, he is going to do his blast
[17:41] attack into your wolf.
[17:43] >> Oh no.
[17:44] >> Fear me. So I get an extra. I get
[17:47] probably roll ones to hit. A damn those
[17:51] tombs.
[17:51] >> I know. Such a sad time for me. Uh the
[17:54] toughness of the [UNIT:Wulfen].
[17:55] >> They're just they're toughness six.
[17:58] >> Good for you.
[18:01] Two, four, five.
[18:03] >> Two.
[18:04] >> Lots on your involve.
[18:05] >> Storm shield saves.
[18:08] >> Uh two go through. Two damage each. Two
[18:11] go. Bang.
[18:11] >> Good. Dead. War flame activate as the
[18:15] [UNIT:Rubric Marines] douse the [UNIT:Terminator Squad]
[18:17] over here in zinc fire killing one and
[18:20] two/3s. I'm very proud of them for that
[18:22] because their [UNIT:Terminator Squad] are very big
[18:23] and scary. Opening up with soul reaper
[18:26] cannons, hellfire missile wracks and
[18:28] infernal combi bolters. I do manage to
[18:30] take down four and a half of the [UNIT:Wulfen].
[18:36] >> You really really are quite fond of your
[18:38] your [UNIT:Wolf Priest], aren't you?
[18:40] >> Well, I'm quite fond of this entire
[18:41] unit. So the fact that it's being
[18:43] whittleled to within an inch of its
[18:44] life, I don't really appreciate quite
[18:46] frankly.
[18:47] >> [UNIT:Wolf Priest] greatest snipers in the
[18:49] game.
[18:49] >> Great.
[18:50] >> Uh they are going to put their fake
[18:51] heart of great bows into him and my
[18:53] baleful devotion from the shaman is
[18:55] going to go into your [UNIT:Terminator Squad].
[18:56] >> I see.
[18:56] >> But it is a great time for a great bow.
[18:59] >> Okay, I understand.
[19:01] >> Yeah.
[19:01] >> Okay.
[19:02] >> Hit you on threes. Re-rolling ones
[19:04] because of the power I put on you.
[19:08] >> The power. The power. That's a lot of
[19:09] sixes.
[19:12] Well, they're lethal.
[19:13] >> Oh, good. Oh, wonderful.
[19:17] >> They're lethal.
[19:18] >> My priest.
[19:21] >> Well, one, two, three, four, five. Five.
[19:25] Minus lots
[19:27] >> minus what?
[19:28] >> Two.
[19:31] >> My priest. One goes through
[19:35] >> two damage.
[19:37] >> I am Wolfman.
[19:38] >> That's what [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red is for, though. Wolf
[19:40] man with stick.
[19:41] >> Well, uh, beltful devotion then.
[19:44] >> What's that?
[19:45] >> I'll let you. Don't worry. It's just my
[19:47] shaman going into your [UNIT:Terminator Squad]. It's
[19:48] just just shaman man. He's got one shot.
[19:52] >> He misses.
[19:53] >> My priest.
[19:56] >> It's [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red time. And he is very very
[19:59] greedy.
[19:59] >> Said [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[20:00] >> So, he is going to split his attacks.
[20:03] Okay.
[20:03] >> Power posing to emulate [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red' power.
[20:06] >> It's very powerful.
[20:07] >> Thank you very much. His gates of [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red
[20:09] is going to go into the [UNIT:Terminator Squad] and
[20:11] the Firestone is going to go into the
[20:12] [UNIT:Wulfen]
[20:13] >> cuz damage.
[20:15] >> Sure.
[20:15] >> I'm going to start with the gates. It's
[20:16] 3d3.
[20:17] >> Here we go.
[20:20] >> There's five shots.
[20:21] >> Reasonable.
[20:22] >> Five.
[20:22] >> Opens his eye.
[20:24] >> I I captain
[20:27] roll. Not re-rolling ones to hit here
[20:30] because that's into the wolfen.
[20:32] >> Okay.
[20:33] >> Am I minus one to hit? Uh minus one to
[20:35] wound if I'm higher than your toughness.
[20:36] That's the [UNIT:Terminator Squad],
[20:39] >> wyches what I'm going into currently.
[20:40] >> Oh, then yes.
[20:43] >> Well, good for you. That is two
[20:45] devastating wounds and two lots of three
[20:46] damage and two [UNIT:Terminator Squad] just dead.
[20:49] >> Oh,
[20:50] >> yeah.
[20:50] >> I see.
[20:51] >> So, we don't have to worry about it.
[20:52] Excellent. Let's move on to the
[20:53] firestorm.
[20:55] Uh, that is seven shots. How many are
[20:56] left in the unit?
[20:58] >> Five.
[20:59] >> Eight shots.
[21:00] >> Oh, good.
[21:01] >> Eight. Excellent.
[21:02] >> Come on, Pri. Oh, sorry. I've got old
[21:04] priesties wounds. Uh, I can [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] one
[21:07] to hit against you.
[21:09] >> Okay,
[21:09] >> cool. I hit you all of the times.
[21:11] >> Oh, no.
[21:12] >> Three is to toughness five.
[21:14] >> Toughness six.
[21:15] >> Oh, four's wui.
[21:19] >> God dangus. Damn it, [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[21:22] Cool.
[21:23] That is
[21:25] >> or
[21:25] >> no, because two of those are
[21:26] devastating. And then uh two two at
[21:29] minus uh minus one.
[21:32] >> Oh, those are okay.
[21:33] >> Well, but two do die.
[21:34] >> Two more dead. Yes.
[21:35] >> Only got two left.
[21:36] >> Good.
[21:37] >> Swung my hammer.
[21:38] >> You can bring them back.
[21:39] >> Melted them into
[21:41] >> wolf goo.
[21:42] >> Wolf mess.
[21:43] >> Oh,
[21:44] >> big puddles of wolf. Wolf puddles. Meat
[21:48] slop.
[21:49] >> Fighting face.
[21:50] >> My [UNIT:Mutalith Vortex Beast] couldn't fail, so
[21:52] he's just gone straight in.
[21:53] >> Just waddled in.
[21:54] >> Uh, my botentled mo.
[21:55] >> Oh no.
[21:56] >> Going to snack on some [UNIT:Terminator Squad].
[21:58] >> Oh god.
[21:58] >> Yum.
[21:59] >> No one wants that.
[22:00] >> I do.
[22:01] >> Save me, [UNIT:Logan Grimnar].
[22:04] Why would you say that?
[22:04] >> It's not gone well, has it?
[22:06] >> Hit you once.
[22:08] >> He's He's He's currently full.
[22:11] >> That is a wound, though.
[22:13] >> Nice. What's the AP?
[22:15] >> I'd rather not talk.
[22:17] >> Oh, sorry. No, ignore me. It is It's AP.
[22:20] Uh AP2.
[22:21] >> Doesn't matter.
[22:22] >> Oh,
[22:22] >> Crux Terminatis.
[22:23] >> It was actually the M clause I was going
[22:25] with, but I rolled the right number and
[22:26] I was wounding on the correct thing.
[22:27] >> Okay.
[22:28] >> I just
[22:30] >> more.
[22:31] >> No.
[22:32] >> Oh, you've done. You're done. I'm going
[22:33] to hit you back now.
[22:36] >> I will retort.
[22:37] >> I'm going to spend this CP right here
[22:39] >> on your brain box.
[22:40] >> I'm going to flick this coin and give it
[22:41] to the all father. Flick. Thank you for
[22:44] your partnage patronage. Even
[22:47] >> I mean you did part with the coin.
[22:49] >> Yeah. Uh we'll start off with the what
[22:52] remains of the unit. So we got a power
[22:55] fist from the assault cannon chat.
[22:57] >> He deserved better.
[22:58] >> What?
[22:59] >> He deserved better.
[23:00] >> He deserves nothing. Um, I've spent the
[23:03] CP on Umbrella Frosty. Did I say that?
[23:04] Yes.
[23:05] >> Oh, yeah.
[23:06] >> He had it on your head.
[23:07] >> Partnage. Uh, one wound AP2.
[23:10] >> Five up.
[23:11] >> Oh,
[23:13] the relic. Great axe.
[23:14] >> Oh, that sure is a great axe.
[23:16] >> It is a great axe. Actually, it's going
[23:18] to axe you a question.
[23:19] >> What is the question?
[23:20] >> The question is, I've wounded you twice.
[23:22] >> It's not a question.
[23:24] >> AP2.
[23:26] >> One goes three. Damage
[23:27] >> three.
[23:29] >> Two go through. He's down to five
[23:31] >> now. Time for [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist]. Rock fists, fists
[23:34] of rock, hammer of steel.
[23:37] >> What else does he have?
[23:38] >> Loins of wolf.
[23:40] >> Uh, lethal because I am a monster.
[23:43] >> One lethal hit. Um, I'll be wounding you
[23:47] on threes cuz anti monster. Three.
[23:49] >> I am a monster.
[23:51] >> Okay. Three wounds. Eight.
[23:53] >> Five up invulnerable. Save. It doesn't
[23:55] matter. Two. Go through damage.
[23:56] >> Six in total.
[24:00] Boom.
[24:00] >> So, you're telling me if I save two of
[24:02] these, he's alive,
[24:04] >> apparently.
[24:07] >> One wound left.
[24:13] >> That is the end of my turn.
[24:14] >> Very, very nice turn. That was
[24:15] >> um I do get stomp hostile objective cuz
[24:17] I am technically stolen that one from
[24:19] you cuz uh
[24:20] >> there's no technically about it. You
[24:21] have stolen it. You already see four to
[24:23] see three.
[24:24] >> Exactly. Uh I didn't quite get
[24:26] assassinate. I really thought I was
[24:27] going to get that, but I'm going to
[24:28] discard it for an extra command point
[24:30] cuz why not?
[24:31] >> Best use about that is that he can use
[24:33] his healing balms and
[24:35] >> that's why
[24:36] >> moisturize one of the [UNIT:Wulfen] to life.
[24:38] >> Anyway, we'll move on from that. It's
[24:41] now your turn.
[24:43] [FACTION:Space Wolves], [FACTION:Space Wolves], wolf, wolf.
[24:45] >> Exactly.
[24:49] >> Turn two for the [FACTION:Space Wolves]. Fel
[24:53] Finris. Uh, I've drawn a tempting target
[24:55] and overwhelming force.
[24:56] >> I see.
[24:57] >> What are the tempting targets? Please
[24:59] tempt me.
[25:01] >> It's difficult actually because um you
[25:04] can get to a lot of them with with some
[25:07] ease. Um
[25:09] >> I am nimble.
[25:10] >> Come back to me.
[25:11] >> Come back to you.
[25:12] >> Come back to me.
[25:13] >> Okay. Uh
[25:15] >> that one.
[25:16] >> That one? Yes. Okay. All right. That's
[25:19] good. Um Okay. So I I I get it. You're
[25:24] keeping old Logan away. Yeah,
[25:25] >> I understand.
[25:28] >> Yeah,
[25:29] >> I brought one of my [UNIT:Wulfen] to life.
[25:30] He's been moisturized back to health.
[25:32] >> Woof.
[25:32] >> Yeah, he he is moisturized, hydrated,
[25:35] staying in his lane,
[25:36] >> flourishing.
[25:36] >> I'm going to put [STRATAGEM:Oath of Moment] on that
[25:38] big guy.
[25:38] >> Oh, you absolute roer.
[25:40] >> Big red guy over there. Kill you for
[25:41] that now.
[25:43] >> I mean, kind of, but I can't actually
[25:46] get much that way. If I can do some
[25:48] damage to him now, I can do more later.
[25:50] The [UNIT:Terminator Squad] are tricky because
[25:52] there's not much space around them, so I
[25:54] can't fit many bases there when I'm in
[25:55] combat. 20 [UNIT:Blood Claws]. I'm going to get
[25:57] about three of them in. Um, yeah, it's
[25:59] it's a bit of a funny mosh pit at the
[26:02] moment. So, I'm going
[26:03] >> to mystery mayhem.
[26:05] >> Yeah, I'm going to be tempted. I'm going
[26:07] to overwhelm you and I'm going to uh
[26:09] oath that moment. The movement phase
[26:12] will begin with the Wolfen. This uh
[26:14] heavily moisturized wolf man will uh
[26:16] lead the charge, followed by the wolf
[26:18] priest and his two friends. Yeah, I have
[26:20] no self-control and I have too many CP
[26:22] and nothing to do with him. So, [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red
[26:23] is going to [STRATAGEM:Fire Overwatch].
[26:25] >> Damn you.
[26:26] >> Devastating scenes as as [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red does uh
[26:29] pour his psychic might into the [UNIT:Wulfen]
[26:32] and only the [UNIT:Wolf Priest] remains.
[26:34] >> My wolfen, you go apologize to Fletcher.
[26:37] >> I'm sorry, Fletcher. Please don't hurt
[26:38] me.
[26:39] >> The [UNIT:Blood Claws] then make a much longer
[26:42] advance this time getting a mighty six
[26:44] being led by [UNIT:Ragnar Blackmane]. We're going to
[26:46] swamp the center objective and hold it
[26:49] with tooth and claw. The mighty machine
[26:53] spirit sends the land raider forwards.
[26:56] It opens it mechanical moore and outsp
[26:59] spews the [UNIT:Wolf Guard [Legends]]. They're not wolf
[27:03] god. Oh, they are wolf god. They're
[27:04] headtakers. Whoa. And finally, the
[27:06] [UNIT:Wolf Guard Terminators] led by Logan are
[27:08] advancing up the boards. Their prey was
[27:13] denied from them. So they are on the
[27:15] hunt for blood and vengeance. Shooting
[27:19] phase is going to begin with this here.
[27:20] Lamb raider opening up into
[27:22] >> that here muty
[27:23] >> vortex muty booty.
[27:26] >> I've hit you once.
[27:29] >> I have not wounded you.
[27:31] >> The godammer laz cannons.
[27:32] >> I see
[27:34] the
[27:35] >> even God cannot witness me.
[27:36] >> Good grief. Okay.
[27:39] >> Jesus Christ.
[27:42] Ah,
[27:42] >> the multimelter.
[27:45] It is one hit. Multi melter.
[27:48] >> Oh my god.
[27:50] Well, those all ones to wound.
[27:52] >> The hunter killer missile
[27:56] is a hit. Hunter killer missile is a
[28:00] wound.
[28:01] >> 10.
[28:01] >> Wait, what shot the hunter killer last
[28:03] time? That one. Yes. Right in your
[28:05] tentacles. More.
[28:07] >> Oh my god.
[28:11] The absorbable pistol from the wolf
[28:14] priest.
[28:15] The [UNIT:Wolf Priest]. It's a hit. A lethal
[28:18] hit.
[28:20] >> Come on, [UNIT:Wolf Priest].
[28:22] >> Oh.
[28:22] >> Oh, don't don't no.
[28:27] >> It was all part of the plan.
[28:28] >> Yeah,
[28:29] >> the stormb bolter. The trusty
[28:30] stormbbolter. We have got one wound
[28:32] through on the stormb bolter. What's
[28:33] minus on stormb bolter?
[28:35] >> None. So four up.
[28:37] >> Yes.
[28:41] The temptation I have to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] it just
[28:43] to wind you up is so strong,
[28:45] >> but it's not worth it.
[28:46] >> Feel no pain though.
[28:51] >> Deadly demise. Is this where I roll a
[28:53] six?
[28:53] >> I don't know.
[28:55] >> Oh.
[28:56] >> Oh, very close. Very close.
[28:58] >> Oh, he does go down.
[28:59] >> The trusty stormbbolter of the space
[29:01] walls. Shame the priest couldn't do it.
[29:03] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shame the godamn las cannons
[29:06] couldn't do it. Oh,
[29:07] >> don't be like that. One more bit of
[29:09] shooting to do. I'm going to spend a
[29:10] command point here for pinning fire.
[29:13] >> I see. What do I mean?
[29:14] >> Um because I have uh I'm shooting into
[29:17] [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red. I'm going to pin him.
[29:19] >> What does that mean?
[29:20] >> It means you subtract two from your move
[29:23] and your charge rolls.
[29:25] >> Only if you hit me,
[29:26] >> which might help.
[29:28] >> God hammers.
[29:30] >> I hit you once.
[29:33] >> 11.
[29:33] >> [STRATAGEM:Oath of Moment].
[29:34] >> Yeah, that is true. That is correct.
[29:36] >> My moment has been oath. Is he might as
[29:37] well hit it?
[29:38] >> No.
[29:39] >> One damage.
[29:40] >> What's his tus?
[29:42] >> 11. Don't forget he has a monster
[29:44] though.
[29:45] >> One wound.
[29:46] >> One.
[29:47] >> One wound.
[29:47] >> Minus three. Laser cannon.
[29:52] >> Going to turn to zero.
[29:53] >> Huh?
[29:54] >> With the CP, I'm going to turn it to
[29:55] zero.
[29:55] >> Fine.
[29:56] >> Oh, so
[29:58] >> the heavy bumpter. My multi melter is
[30:00] out of range, of course. One lethal hit,
[30:02] one sustained.
[30:06] Uh, one one at minus one. But you are
[30:08] getting cover.
[30:10] >> I care not.
[30:11] >> You You don't care.
[30:12] >> Healthy [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[30:13] >> Multi's not in range. I don't want to
[30:14] extend my charge into the Rubik's over
[30:16] there. The stormbbolter.
[30:18] >> The humble stormbolter.
[30:20] >> The humble stormbbolter. Two sixes or
[30:23] none. Uh, that, believe it or not, is my
[30:26] shooting face.
[30:27] >> Congratulations for doing a single wound
[30:28] to a mutilated.
[30:30] >> Oh, this.
[30:31] >> Good grief. Slanderous.
[30:34] >> Oh. Oh, it's time for the charge phase.
[30:36] Uh, binding 10 drills are currently
[30:39] wrapped around the wolf and ankles of my
[30:41] terminals over here. So, it's going to
[30:42] be a 9 in charge into [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red. Now, they
[30:44] are free. That is a four.
[30:50] I'm going to spend a C. Yes, I'm going
[30:53] to spend a CP. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
[30:56] The wolf p is going to give it a go cuz
[30:58] why not? No, he fails. Uh, we'll move
[31:01] over there then to the [UNIT:Wolf Guard [Legends]]
[31:03] headtakers into that large unit of
[31:05] [UNIT:Rubric Marines] at the back over there. They do
[31:07] make it on an 11. We'll move them in
[31:10] face time. I'm
[31:11] >> scared.
[31:12] >> The headtakers will take your heads or
[31:14] the dust that remains in your helms.
[31:16] >> Oh, I mean there is a nice juicy head in
[31:18] your saucer. I suppose
[31:20] >> maybe.
[31:21] >> Yeah. Um, you are my quarry over there.
[31:23] So, I get devastating wounds here. Um, I
[31:25] can [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] ones to hit. I think yes
[31:28] because of my tempered ferocity.
[31:31] >> Uh couple of twos and then lots of
[31:33] sixes. One, two, three, four sixes,
[31:36] >> which are lethal
[31:37] >> for the uh the lethal character unit
[31:39] >> and sustained.
[31:40] >> I see.
[31:41] >> Because of my tempered philosophy.
[31:43] >> Let me pull those out as as already
[31:45] having wounded.
[31:46] >> Oh, thanks.
[31:46] >> You're welcome.
[31:47] >> Thanks very much.
[31:48] >> Very helpful.
[31:49] >> I didn't [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] those ones.
[31:54] >> Another one.
[31:54] >> One more. Uh, it will be threes to wound
[31:57] you. Sixes are devastating.
[31:59] >> Mhm.
[32:00] >> Oh, I dropped one on the floor. Okay.
[32:03] Many wounds.
[32:05] 1 2 3 four five devastating wounds.
[32:10] >> And
[32:12] uh 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 a minus
[32:16] two.
[32:18] >> Head takers. Uh
[32:19] >> this unit has the [UNIT:Exalted Sorcerer] in.
[32:21] So they have a four up invulnerable
[32:22] save.
[32:22] >> Oh, how unpleasant.
[32:25] for me.
[32:26] >> Oh. Oh, they stabbed your force field.
[32:29] >> One, two, three, four, five, six,
[32:33] six, seven, eight, nine, 10, and then
[32:36] >> five devastating wounds on your
[32:38] [UNIT:Sorcerer]. They really want his head.
[32:39] >> Yeah. Well, he's only got five wounds.
[32:41] So, that is the unit wiped.
[32:45] >> A,
[32:45] >> you cut off my head. Yes, that's what we
[32:48] do. That's not very nice. Sorry for all
[32:50] of the stuff that happened before. Shut
[32:52] up.
[32:53] That is the end of my turn. Very
[32:55] reasonable turn. Very reasonable. Um, so
[32:58] I've got attempting target over there.
[33:00] >> Yes.
[33:00] >> Now on all of the objectives except your
[33:02] home one, wyches nice.
[33:04] >> Um, I've got three points for
[33:05] overwhelming force
[33:07] >> and I feel like a big swarm.
[33:09] >> Yeah, is it I feel like it is going to
[33:11] be quite difficult now to uh pull you
[33:12] off these objectives, but I'm going to
[33:14] try my darnest. You
[33:15] >> got a great big [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red over there. I
[33:17] >> sure do. [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[33:20] >> She [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red indeed. [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red
[33:25] >> battle round three.
[33:26] >> I once again have a plan.
[33:28] >> Okay,
[33:28] >> I have bring it down an overwhelming
[33:30] force wyches try and kill a bunch of
[33:31] stuff over there.
[33:32] >> I get it.
[33:32] >> Which hopefully I should be able to do.
[33:34] I am going for psychic maelstrom to add
[33:37] one to my wound rolls for now.
[33:38] >> Nice.
[33:39] >> And I am going to try and kill as much
[33:41] as I possibly can this turn.
[33:42] >> I understand.
[33:44] The [UNIT:Terminator Squad] are moving first
[33:46] encircling the [UNIT:Blood Claws] in a way so
[33:49] as to be in as minimal danger as
[33:50] possible but so that I can still see all
[33:52] of them because that is neat. Where else
[33:55] is neat? Murder. Murder's neat. The
[33:59] [UNIT:Rubric Marines] are going to move forward
[34:01] so that they can see many many targets.
[34:04] Uh and then [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red is going to come and
[34:05] join them because he doesn't really know
[34:07] what he's doing. It kind of depends on
[34:09] how well he can do. And um he's he's
[34:13] faltering a bit in his self-belief. Poor
[34:16] guy. Oh, don't crush your friend.
[34:20] >> As a reaction, I'm going to spin the
[34:21] command point on thunderous pursuit. And
[34:23] these [UNIT:Terminator Squad] are going to move back
[34:25] into their Lamb Raider. Safe and sound.
[34:29] Safe and sound. But now,
[34:36] [Music]
[34:39] >> guess what? This guy made a boo boo.
[34:42] >> Bit of a woofer.
[34:45] >> I forgot about Curse of the [UNIT:Wulfen].
[34:47] Their OC zero.
[34:48] >> Yeah,
[34:48] >> I've not used [UNIT:Wulfen] yet since their new
[34:50] book. I did a stupid.
[34:53] >> It's okay. So, what I'm going to do to
[34:55] uh fix this is change the score uh that
[34:58] we have right now because I didn't get
[35:00] three points my home objective.
[35:02] >> However, to allow them to do something,
[35:05] I will more than likely be doing a
[35:07] coordinated strike um and doing a picky
[35:10] upy turn in the fight phase. Um and put
[35:13] them somewhere else so I can use them
[35:15] later on because they are not scoring me
[35:17] that objective right now.
[35:17] >> No, no, no.
[35:19] >> Psychic phase is underway. M
[35:21] >> I have managed to temporarily search my
[35:24] [UNIT:Rubric Marines] because your [UNIT:Terminator Squad]
[35:25] are no longer there. However, I did kill
[35:26] one and a half of them.
[35:28] >> Yes,
[35:28] >> brats. Um I have got destiny's ruin and
[35:31] twist of fate on the [UNIT:Blood Claws]. The
[35:33] twist of fate is the mega twister of
[35:35] fate. So it is uh I've got AP2 against
[35:38] you. However, I did have to use a uh
[35:40] desk. Oh, which one is it?
[35:43] >> Arcane focus to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] um because I
[35:46] rolled very very very badly.
[35:48] >> Okay,
[35:48] >> on that. Now it is time for a doombolt.
[35:50] >> The extra AP is very nice because a lot
[35:53] I might not be getting any sets.
[35:54] >> That's the point. Oh,
[35:55] >> I'm going to doom bolt your land raider.
[35:57] I nearly called it a rhino.
[35:59] >> Rhino raider.
[36:00] >> 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
[36:05] >> See, he gets an extra two now.
[36:07] >> On a 12. Is it on a No, it is on 11.
[36:11] >> It's D3 plus three.
[36:13] >> D3 plus three. Okay,
[36:16] >> it's four mortal wounds.
[36:17] >> Four mortal wounds. you allow me to have
[36:19] left?
[36:20] >> Um, I can never Oh, uh, I 12.
[36:24] >> Oh, still quite a lot.
[36:26] >> Well, how many you do? Four.
[36:27] >> Four.
[36:27] >> 12.
[36:30] >> Start of the shooting phase. I'm very
[36:31] greedy and I'm splitting my tanks.
[36:34] >> Uh, the gaze of [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red is going to the
[36:36] [UNIT:Blood Claws] and my S's fire. No,
[36:39] >> the gaze of [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red is going into the
[36:40] land raider and Z's Firestorm is going
[36:42] into the [UNIT:Blood Claws]. Understand?
[36:43] >> Because it's a big unit and it's blast.
[36:45] Yeah.
[36:45] >> And that makes me excited.
[36:46] >> Five. Um, I'm getting plus one to wound,
[36:49] so I'm wounding you on twos.
[36:50] >> You sure are.
[36:51] >> Yeah. Rerunning ones to hit.
[36:53] >> Okay.
[36:54] >> The AP is a million.
[36:56] >> A million AP.
[36:57] >> Million whole AP.
[36:58] >> That seems unreasonable.
[36:59] >> Well, yeah, I am an unreasonable person.
[37:02] Um,
[37:04] >> twos. Cuz what's the toughness on them?
[37:06] >> They're they're merely toughness for
[37:08] >> Well, cuz it's psychic and I'm plus one
[37:10] two wound. Two, four, six, eight.
[37:13] >> What is the AP?
[37:15] >> Three.
[37:17] Three. Yeah. Oh, okay. So, I do get
[37:19] eight because of the the twist of fate.
[37:21] >> How many?
[37:22] >> Uh, one, two, three, four, five, six,
[37:25] seven, eight.
[37:26] >> Eight sixes. Oh, wait. Does it ignore
[37:29] cover?
[37:30] >> Yeah.
[37:32] >> So, I save one. What's the damage?
[37:34] >> Two.
[37:35] >> Seven are dead.
[37:36] >> Seven are dead. Cool. Now, into your
[37:38] land reader.
[37:39] >> Okay.
[37:40] >> Two hit you.
[37:41] >> Yes.
[37:42] >> I hit you all the time.
[37:43] >> Ow. The [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red
[37:45] >> Tus 12
[37:46] >> 12
[37:47] >> but plus one to wound so winning you on
[37:49] fours
[37:50] >> seven
[37:51] >> well that's one one normal wound up at
[37:53] minus two
[37:54] >> okay
[37:55] >> and then two debies
[37:56] >> minus two you say does this ignore cover
[37:59] >> no
[38:00] >> then that's okay
[38:01] >> minus you don't you're not your is not
[38:04] getting cover I'm cover
[38:06] >> cuz I'm in the cover
[38:07] >> fine um what's the
[38:09] >> three each nine damage
[38:13] three wounds
[38:16] Zeitian fire and fury pours upon this
[38:19] poor little wolf and priest. Um, he is
[38:22] slain burnt to a crisp.
[38:24] >> Why was I brought to this battle? I made
[38:26] the list 2005 points. I didn't even get
[38:28] to swing my crows. I saw my wolf and the
[38:30] dead.
[38:32] underestimated the fury of the Scaraba
[38:35] cult [UNIT:Terminator Squad] as they rip apart all
[38:39] but one of the [UNIT:Blood Claws] and right now
[38:42] black man his man is now red with blood
[38:46] >> blood of his brothers
[38:47] >> we need Russ back we're in trouble
[38:51] >> devastating
[38:52] >> AP4 bolters huh
[38:54] >> that will do the trick
[38:55] >> that was that was savage yeah
[38:56] >> you just killed 12 [UNIT:Grey Hunters] just
[38:59] like that
[38:59] >> yeah the zyor Oh, enlightened with the
[39:02] shaman are all that's left.
[39:04] >> Good.
[39:05] >> I'm going to put them into your
[39:06] headtakers.
[39:06] >> Fair enough.
[39:07] >> I'm going to start with my great bows
[39:08] cuz they are after all the greatest
[39:10] bows.
[39:10] >> Agree. I I feel like [UNIT:Ragnar Blackmane] is prime for
[39:12] a charge.
[39:13] >> Yeah. Yes. Pot potentially.
[39:15] >> I understand.
[39:16] >> Potentially.
[39:18] >> Their toughness is tough.
[39:20] >> Uh the [UNIT:Grey Hunters], the head takes just
[39:23] four. They're merely space marines just
[39:25] very very murderous.
[39:26] >> Three at minus two.
[39:27] >> Three at minus two. Ignoring cover.
[39:29] Ignoring cover.
[39:29] >> No, not ignoring cover. Sorry. Ignoring
[39:30] cover. No, it is ignoring cover. What
[39:32] the hell? Why is that?
[39:33] >> Two. One goes through.
[39:34] >> One goes through. Damage two.
[39:36] >> I am still alive with one.
[39:39] >> Cool. It's time to shaman you.
[39:41] >> Ah, the shaman
[39:42] >> bale full devotion.
[39:44] >> I hit on threes.
[39:46] >> Very well.
[39:49] >> That is one devastating move.
[39:51] >> Uh, my head taker is no more.
[39:53] >> I took his head.
[39:54] >> His head's been taken.
[39:55] >> Sploot.
[39:56] >> Awkward for him.
[39:57] >> Yeah. Charge face. We are starting with
[39:59] the [UNIT:Terminator Squad] into the remnants of the
[40:01] [UNIT:Blood Claws]
[40:03] with a nine. They're very, very eager.
[40:05] >> Oh man. Uh, I'll move the rest of them
[40:07] in in a minute because I need a very big
[40:09] charge from [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red to get into this land
[40:10] raider cuz I need to get through my men.
[40:12] Oh, goodbye dice. I need that. Please,
[40:15] [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red. Please. Oh. Oh. Oh, baby. Can
[40:19] >> Minus two.
[40:20] >> Oh, no. The minus
[40:22] >> pinned
[40:23] >> the minus two. Minus poo. Yay!
[40:28] >> Welcome to Termination Station.
[40:30] >> Thank you.
[40:30] >> Beep beep. This is the last stop.
[40:33] >> Oh god.
[40:34] >> Uh I'm going to start with my prospering
[40:35] confessions. I've got six of those in
[40:37] and my two force weapons.
[40:38] >> Okay.
[40:41] >> I hit you on threes.
[40:44] >> I'm not rerolling anymore.
[40:45] >> Lot of ones and twos there, I'm afraid.
[40:47] >> Yeah. Yeah.
[40:49] >> [UNIT:Ragnar Blackmane]'s parrying toughness.
[40:52] >> Four. No.
[40:53] >> So with the prospering capes, it will be
[40:55] threes to wound you. will be
[40:57] >> prospering. You see on Prospero
[41:00] burnt. Wonder how that happened. Uh two
[41:04] four six please at minus two.
[41:06] >> What's the damage?
[41:07] >> Two.
[41:08] >> Oh, one at a time cuz I've got a
[41:10] invulnerable. Oh, he's dead. Um okay.
[41:14] Four preventable save from [UNIT:Ragnar Blackmane].
[41:16] >> Harry
[41:20] think he's dead.
[41:20] >> How many does he have?
[41:22] >> Is it eight?
[41:23] >> No.
[41:25] Oh, [UNIT:Ragnar Blackmane].
[41:26] >> [UNIT:Ragnar Blackmane].
[41:28] >> That is my turn.
[41:29] >> That was quite good.
[41:31] >> Yeah, I'm a bit sad I didn't get to the
[41:33] Lamb Raider cuz I do have Bring It Down.
[41:35] >> Oh, I'm sorry. Was killing 20 bug claws
[41:37] and [UNIT:Ragnar Blackmane] not enough?
[41:38] >> No, it wasn't. I need more blood.
[41:40] >> Good grief.
[41:40] >> I am very murderous.
[41:42] >> You've taken my objective.
[41:43] >> Yes, you just have one.
[41:45] >> That's true.
[41:46] >> Look at you go. Um I do get overwhelming
[41:49] I don't get overwhelming force.
[41:51] >> You do. They were there.
[41:52] >> Oh yeah, I do. Remember those black
[41:53] claws with every minute go?
[41:56] >> Oh, what a shame. What did you get? Oh,
[41:58] no. I remember.
[42:00] >> I wasn't expecting to kill them all.
[42:03] >> So, in my head, I hadn't gotten it. Uh,
[42:04] so I did get a bombing force. Uh, I do
[42:06] not get bring down. I'm going to discard
[42:08] it for a command point because command
[42:09] points are good.
[42:11] >> Command points are great.
[42:13] >> Speaking of command points, I'm going to
[42:14] spend one on coordinated strikes. I'm
[42:17] going to pick up these [UNIT:Wulfen] that are
[42:18] OC
[42:20] everyone. Yeah, OC zero [UNIT:Wulfen] can't
[42:22] hold objectives as it turns out. Uh
[42:24] there was no characters there to give
[42:26] them the curse of the wolf and curse
[42:28] breakers. So I'm going to pick them up.
[42:30] They're going to come down strategic
[42:31] reserve anywhere on the board edge now
[42:33] cuz we're in battle round three. Prepare
[42:35] yourself for the retort will be full of
[42:37] fangs.
[42:38] >> Bitey
[42:43] battle round three. No turn three for me
[42:46] it is.
[42:46] >> I mean it's still battle round three.
[42:48] Yeah.
[42:48] >> I've drawn my cards. They've got Mark
[42:49] for Death and No Prisoners, wyches all
[42:52] right. Actually,
[42:52] >> that's not too bad. What's Mark for
[42:53] Death?
[42:54] >> [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red, the [UNIT:Terminator Squad], and these chaos space marines
[42:56] down here.
[42:56] >> Understand. I am going to put my moment
[42:58] onto [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red
[43:00] >> cuz he's a massive problem.
[43:01] >> Yes.
[43:02] >> Um, so I've got some figuring out to do.
[43:07] It's a bit tricky cuz I don't have much
[43:09] stuff left. Not much stuff to start
[43:10] with, actually. Um, so I need to think
[43:12] about where to position myself, what to
[43:14] focus on, and where to uh put my claws.
[43:17] This is the movement phase and this is a
[43:19] perfect moment. This is a door over here
[43:21] and generally things come through doors.
[43:22] So I'm going to put my space marines
[43:24] here coming through the door of their
[43:25] lamb raider. Not only because it makes
[43:27] sense from a scientific standpoint, but
[43:29] also because I can't then be overwatched
[43:31] because of my massive bulk. [UNIT:Ragnar Blackmane] and
[43:34] his band of merry [UNIT:Terminator Squad] are moving
[43:36] forwards. They've got quite a long
[43:38] charge ahead of them. But we need to
[43:39] start getting up the board to protect
[43:41] this objective over here. I am then
[43:43] going to move back around with the Lamb
[43:45] Raider so we can firmly place its butt
[43:48] onto this objective. Excuse me. I'm
[43:51] Logan Grimar. Make room for my wolves.
[43:54] Over here, the headtakers are moving
[43:56] forward towards their quarry, which are
[43:58] the [UNIT:Terminator Squad], which they chose after
[44:00] they massacred the other blue men at the
[44:03] back.
[44:03] >> Blue.
[44:10] >> It's shooting phase. I'm going to start
[44:12] off with my freshly arrived [UNIT:Wulfen] over
[44:15] there.
[44:16] >> Don't kill us
[44:18] zero. Um I am going to launch there. Uh
[44:23] Storm Frag auto launches at you. I've
[44:25] got 20 shots cuz of blast and stuff.
[44:27] >> Um yes. Here we go.
[44:30] Uh how many of fours?
[44:34] >> That's not bad.
[44:35] >> Not bad.
[44:36] >> I'm tough as four.
[44:37] >> It's not a character unit. Uh top of
[44:38] four. to force to wound you. That is
[44:42] one, two. Oh, three wounds.
[44:44] >> Three wounds. Two. Two die.
[44:47] >> Oh, wow. How exciting.
[44:48] >> Yeah.
[44:49] >> Yay.
[44:50] >> The Lamb Raider on the flank next to
[44:52] [UNIT:Logan Grimnar] unleashes his entire
[44:54] arsenal into the character sniping chaos space marines
[44:57] over here. We do manage to kill all
[44:59] three of them. The shaman, however, is
[45:01] still alive.
[45:03] >> Last little bit of shooting. Um, we've
[45:05] done no damage over there from the
[45:07] headtakers. They're not for for shooting
[45:09] though. This lamb raider did one piece
[45:12] of damage onto [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[45:14] >> Yeah,
[45:14] >> just the one. Frustrating. Even though
[45:16] he had oath the moment. Going to finish
[45:18] off the shooting with RJ and his pals.
[45:20] >> RJ Jack's magic hammer is going to be
[45:22] flung, wyches very exciting. But we do
[45:24] the assault cannon first into these
[45:26] chaps down here.
[45:28] >> The chaps. The chaps. One lethal hit for
[45:32] the chaps.
[45:36] That's two devastating wounds and three
[45:39] regular wounds if you please for my um
[45:42] assault cannon.
[45:43] >> Nothing.
[45:44] >> No
[45:45] >> damage.
[45:46] >> One.
[45:47] >> Uh so you've killed two because mom's
[45:49] already wounded.
[45:50] >> Yes.
[45:52] >> Wait, you did three devastating wounds.
[45:55] >> Two, I think.
[45:55] >> Two. Yeah. So you've killed Yeah, you've
[45:57] killed two.
[45:57] >> Great. Right. And then it is faux
[46:00] hammer.
[46:01] >> Faux hammer is coming in.
[46:03] >> Lethal. Lethal hit
[46:06] AP two
[46:09] damage three.
[46:12] >> You've killed three.
[46:13] >> I killed him with his magic hammer.
[46:15] >> Yay.
[46:16] >> Oh, I'm going to charge them now.
[46:17] >> Charge them into that same squad.
[46:21] Oh, I needed a six. He does make it in.
[46:24] Uh, I'm going to try and charge with
[46:26] Logan and Pals. You need a 10 into the
[46:28] Terminator in the middle.
[46:29] >> I see.
[46:30] >> That's not a 10. That is not a 10. Um,
[46:32] and then we're going to charge with the
[46:34] headtakers. They can't really fail, but
[46:35] what a nice big charge. That's a seven.
[46:38] Reasonable
[46:38] >> respectable charge.
[46:39] >> Final charge. [UNIT:Wulfen] into the shaman.
[46:42] >> Oh, not my shaman.
[46:43] >> A nine. Four, five, six, seven. Oh, you

[46:54] I'm going to move them in right now.
[46:56] >> OC
[46:58] fight face. Headtakers versus scarabult
[47:02] [UNIT:Terminator Squad]. Whom is the most choppy?
[47:05] >> Well, I'm the most psychic.
[47:07] >> I'm much bigger than you.
[47:09] >> That must have something to something to
[47:10] do with it.
[47:10] >> We're very insecure about our height.
[47:12] >> I have sustained. I have lethal hits. I
[47:13] have [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] ones. I have devastating
[47:15] wounds. I have precision. I also have a
[47:17] wolfgar bat leader within six inches of
[47:18] my wolf, which means they're OC1. Woo!
[47:22] Kapat. The bone dice are my wolfgar
[47:24] battle leader. Yes.
[47:26] >> Um because he hits on twos. I'm going to
[47:28] [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] these ones here, of which there
[47:30] are a lot of ones, but quite a lot of
[47:33] sixes though, so that's nice.
[47:34] >> And only one full miss,
[47:36] >> right? Let's [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] these in here. That
[47:39] is a weird Cox dice. Okay, few more
[47:43] ones. A few more sixes.
[47:45] >> Yes.
[47:46] >> Okay.

[47:51] >> four, five, six, seven,
[47:54] eight, nine.
[47:55] >> Nine sustained. And then you need to
[47:57] grab
[47:58] >> I'm going to put all of these over here.
[48:00] Nine sustained and then three,
[48:04] six,
[48:05] >> nine lethal. And these are your nine
[48:06] sustained.
[48:07] >> Yes, exactly.
[48:08] >> Force to wound from a very tough and
[48:10] chunky terminator.
[48:11] >> My thunder hammer is my one to wound
[48:14] because of your bodyguard rule.
[48:18] >> Okay, it's it's reasonable. I mean, oh,
[48:22] I've actually failed to wound you quite
[48:24] a lot. At least you had the lethals.
[48:26] >> I had the lethals. That is true. Um,
[48:29] >> there's two debies.
[48:30] >> Two debies. 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

[49:12] please. Pom pom.
[49:13] >> Minus two. You say
[49:14] >> minus two. Pom pom.

[49:18] >> Cool. There's two dead.
[49:19] >> The relic great ax.
[49:22] >> They're great. It sure is great.

[49:54] >> I've wounded you four times. The AP is
[49:58] two, the demarage is three. Does he
[50:00] killed three?
[50:01] >> He's killed the unit. My my exalted
[50:03] [UNIT:Sorcerer] still lives.
[50:04] >> That's cool.
[50:05] >> Hey,
[50:06] >> to the surprise of absolutely no one, my
[50:08] [UNIT:Exalted Sorcerer] on disc of Zech did hit
[50:10] back into the terminator with nothing.
[50:12] However, my [UNIT:Terminator Squad] will attempt to
[50:14] do something.
[50:15] >> Okay,
[50:15] >> my prospering capes into your
[50:17] >> capes.
[50:18] >> Yes, you heard me. Suffering cash
[50:24] threes to hit you. Oh, that's not going
[50:26] well. It's cuz you stress me out making
[50:28] fun of my my words.
[50:30] >> Uh, what's your turn as a taker?

[50:59] >> Three wounds.
[51:00] >> You No, but you saved one.
[51:02] >> One's dead.

[51:07] >> Force weapons from my my lord and my
[51:09] non-lord.
[51:10] >> Lord.
[51:10] >> Um, I'm all out of whack now.
[51:14] >> My non lord.
[51:15] >> Leave me alone. Stop saying things.
[51:18] Three still need you.
[51:19] >> Okay.
[51:23] >> Four at minus one.
[51:25] >> Four or minus one.
[51:26] >> Four at minus one.
[51:29] >> Minus one. They all go through.
[51:31] >> What? How many wounds do they have?
[51:32] >> Three.
[51:33] >> Okay. It's D3 damage.
[51:37] >> One is dead.
[51:44] >> Don't you laugh like that.
[51:48] That is the end of my turn. Not bad. Not
[51:50] bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.
[51:52] Um, haven't taken the center objective
[51:54] there, but I have managed to cut get rid
[51:55] of get through there some of your big
[51:58] tough [UNIT:Terminator Squad], wyches nice. Um,
[52:00] and haven't lost mine in the process. I
[52:02] have taken your home objective. It's
[52:05] gone.
[52:06] >> Yeah. Yeah.
[52:06] >> Ridic of this world. The corruption has
[52:09] been lapped up by the [UNIT:Wulfen] and they
[52:11] have since been cured of their [UNIT:Wulfen]
[52:12] curse. They are now a band of five
[52:14] handsome princes. Um, my Logan is slowly
[52:19] plotting his way into the center. Uh, my
[52:22] [UNIT:Arjac Rockfist]
[52:24] has a big problem to deal with over
[52:26] there that begins with M and ends with
[52:27] Agnes.
[52:29] >> Um, so we'll have to see how that goes.
[52:32] Um, I have scored four points for no
[52:34] prisoners. And I did achieve Mark for
[52:37] Death because your shaman was my gamma
[52:39] target. Um, I decided not to mention it
[52:42] beginning of the turn. Um, so that's
[52:44] that. Over to you then, Mrs. [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[52:53] >> It's a lot dead.
[52:54] >> There's a lot dead.
[52:55] >> Um, I have got three on the primary cuz
[52:58] I am holding that middle objective.
[52:59] Sure.
[53:00] >> Go me. Um, but not holding my home
[53:02] because there are disgusting wolves
[53:04] there. I do have mark for death. No
[53:05] prisoners.
[53:06] >> Okay.
[53:07] >> What is your marked for death? Logan
[53:08] Grimar and his five best pals. That lamb
[53:10] raider over there and the wolfguard
[53:12] headtakers.
[53:13] >> I understand. Um my gamma target will be
[53:16] these [UNIT:Wulfen].
[53:17] >> Understand?
[53:17] >> Yeah. And I'm going to put on impute
[53:21] manifestation to add 6 in to the range
[53:23] characteristic of range weapons equipped
[53:24] by thousand s models in my army.
[53:26] >> How nice.
[53:27] >> Yeah, I don't have any more I can use.
[53:29] Okay.
[53:29] >> So, um do you know what? Just for
[53:32] funsies, I'm going to um going to spend
[53:36] a command point to put [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red with his
[53:39] egotistical power
[53:41] >> back into Wrath of the Immaterium. So,
[53:43] all of his weapons now have devastating
[53:44] wounds.
[53:45] >> Yucky.
[53:49] >> We haven't faces them.
[53:51] >> Mhm.
[53:51] >> Uh [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red is coming over this direction
[53:53] cuz I'm hoping I can I can do some
[53:55] shooty shooty dudes. Um, I have
[53:57] temporarily surged my chaos space marines already onto
[53:59] the objective.
[54:00] >> And I have got Destiny's run and twist
[54:02] of fate off onto your headtakers because
[54:04] I've fallen back with the [UNIT:Terminator Squad].
[54:06] >> Grief.
[54:07] >> There's one more psychic power to do.
[54:09] >> Okay,
[54:10] >> Mantis is going to attempt to doom that
[54:11] rhino again.
[54:13] >> Land Raider. Sorry, it's not Rhino.
[54:14] >> All right,
[54:15] >> I apologize.
[54:19] >> 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 is D3 plus three
[54:24] mortal wings.
[54:25] >> It's dead. Does it explode?
[54:26] >> Let's find out together.
[54:29] >> Oh my god.
[54:30] >> Yes, it does.
[54:31] >> Okay,
[54:32] >> so that is going to be a grand total of
[54:35] D6 mult on my chaos space marines.
[54:37] >> On your goits, the chaos space marines take
[54:40] >> dead.
[54:42] >> Three.
[54:42] >> Three. Reasonable on your [UNIT:Sorcerer].
[54:45] >> Yes.
[54:46] >> Five.
[54:46] >> He's dead.
[54:47] >> Dead.
[54:48] >> Uh are Mr. Rockfist only?
[54:52] >> Two.
[54:52] >> Two. So uh
[54:53] >> one's down to one. One's down to a
[54:55] wound.
[54:55] >> Okay,
[54:56] >> explode.
[54:58] >> Actual shooting phase. Now, uh the only
[55:00] thing person who's going to do anything
[55:02] this turn is [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[55:03] >> Okay,
[55:03] >> I believe in in him. Um I have spent two
[55:06] CP on devastating sorcery so I can
[55:08] [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] my hit rolls and my wound rolls
[55:09] with my psychic weapons. I'm putting the
[55:12] gaze into the [UNIT:Terminator Squad] and the
[55:14] firestorm into the head takers.
[55:15] >> I'm uh six attacks with each.
[55:19] >> Devastating on both. I hit you on twos.
[55:23] Ow.

[55:29] >> Five.
[55:30] >> Two stoing.
[55:34] Holy shimolley.
[55:38] Okay, that's more reasonable. Uh two
[55:40] four five at minus two.
[55:43] >> Kux Terminatus.
[55:46] >> Ow. What's the damage?
[55:48] >> Three.
[55:49] >> Yeah.
[55:49] >> So, one's dead,
[55:51] >> two's dead. Oh no. Is RJ Jack dead?
[55:55] >> Did I kill him with the [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red?
[55:56] >> He's got six wounds.
[55:58] >> I mean, I am a prime mark.
[56:00] >> No,

[56:36] >> Okay.
[56:37] >> And then one, two, three at minus two.
[56:40] Ignoring cover.
[56:41] >> Right. Invulnerable saves. I'd pass one.
[56:44] >> The two damage each.
[56:46] >> Okay.
[56:46] >> So, one dead, two dead.
[56:48] >> One dead. Two dead.
[56:49] >> Two dead cuz. Okay. I've got one head
[56:51] taker and a man left. Got my butter
[56:53] leader left.

[57:43] Yeah. Need
[57:44] >> four.

[57:50] >> You should be quite proud.
[57:50] >> Quite proud of my Primark.
[57:51] >> Yeah.
[57:52] >> Oh, for what it's worth, I did um
[57:54] consolidate into these guys. And I did
[57:57] take two wounds.
[57:57] >> Okay.
[57:58] >> Um just because I like murder and combat
[58:00] and death. Speaking of I get the max
[58:03] points for no prisoners. I only get two
[58:04] for mark for death cuz I didn't quite
[58:06] kill the headtakers, but maybe next
[58:08] time.
[58:11] >> Twilight hours of the game.
[58:12] >> There's not a lot left.
[58:13] >> Not a lot left. Um, I've drawn extend
[58:15] battle lines and air denial. I mean,
[58:17] extend battle lines is terrible. Uh, but
[58:19] air denial might be possible cuz I'm
[58:21] going to come that way with Logan and
[58:22] pals. And we just have to see what
[58:24] happens.
[58:27] >> Movement's done. Very easy. I'll move
[58:29] forward with Logan towards the melee in
[58:30] the middle. Everything else has stayed
[58:31] put.
[58:31] >> Yep.

[58:39] >> I'm not a foe.
[58:40] >> A wound. Is it devastating? Surely.
[58:42] Sure. No, it's not. Minus two damage
[58:45] three one is is turned into miss dead
[58:47] goat.
[58:48] >> Excellent. Uh we'll move on very quickly
[58:49] then to the lamb raider shooting
[58:50] everything into your turn in the middle.
[58:52] Uh shouldn't extend my charge because
[58:54] your character's at the front there.
[58:55] >> Yeah, silly me. What a goose I am.
[58:58] >> Whack. Oh, also they are my oath of

[59:17] variety.
[59:18] >> Two wounds, AP4.
[59:22] >> Why? Why?
[59:24] >> I can do the terminator thing, too.
[59:25] >> The goddamn malas cannon.
[59:27] >> Oh my. What the hell?
[59:32] >> All these lit.
[59:33] >> Okay.
[59:36] >> 23 doesn't damage.
[59:37] >> That's cool.
[59:38] >> Yeah,
[59:39] >> that's not cool.
[59:41] Ah.
[59:45] Oh, one was wounded, so it's fine. Oh.

[59:57] So, one's got a wing left.
[59:58] >> Yeah.
[59:59] >> Logan Grimar is going to finish him off.
[60:00] >> Okay.
[60:01] >> With his Stormbbolter. Any particular
[60:04] type of Stormbbolter? Nope. A completely
[60:06] standard issue Stormbbolter.
[60:10] I hit you twice.
[60:12] I wound you once. No AP. God damn it.
[60:18] Never mind. It is time for the charge
[60:20] phase. [UNIT:Logan Grimnar] and his pet
[60:23] wolves. How to the moon and charge into

[62:24] >> Damage three.
[62:25] >> I've got two wounds left. [UNIT:Logan Grimnar]
[62:27] raises the axe. Morai strikes down upon
[62:31] ye.
[62:32] >> Not me.
[62:33] >> Foul heric. Uh, one lethal. It's
[62:37] strength eight.
[62:38] >> Oh, that's great.
[62:42] Uh, that is four wounds, please.
[62:44] >> You do not wound me on threes.
[62:46] >> Minus three wounds, please. Minus two.
[62:52] >> Three damage.
[62:53] >> That's last attack. I've then got some a
[62:56] couple of a couple of puffers.
[62:57] >> Uh I'm going to spend a CP on destined
[63:00] by fate to turn that to zero. So left.
[63:03] >> It's down to deck and fener.
[63:06] >> Oh woof woof woof.
[63:07] >> What? Oh go on lads. Two lethal hits.
[63:11] Re-rolling. Bite him. Bite him right in.
[63:14] >> What noise they make?
[63:15] >> Huh? Yeah.
[63:16] >> Yeah.
[63:17] >> Exactly.
[63:19] >> Strength five. Oh,
[63:20] >> so four.
[63:21] >> Four wounds.
[63:22] >> Five wounds. Five wounds minus one.
[63:27] >> Yeah. Pulled apart by wolves.
[63:30] >> Oh no.
[63:32] >> RJ Rockfist defends his objective and
[63:36] pummel these chaos space marines into dust.
[63:40] >> And [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red showing off his psychic might
[63:43] absolutely obliterates the brains of
[63:45] these two headtakers.
[63:47] >> That's that end of the turn. Um I have
[63:50] got a fora five. I have discarded extend
[63:54] battle lines because that is no bueno.
[63:55] Um, so I will get a fresh draw in turn
[63:57] five.
[63:59] >> There's a very very big [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red in the
[64:01] middle of the board and he could cause
[64:02] all sorts of problems.
[64:03] >> That I'm going to try and table you
[64:08] >> better.
[64:09] >> Good grief.
[64:10] >> I'm on no primary.
[64:11] >> You're not.
[64:12] >> I've drawn defense stronghold, which I
[64:14] could try, an area of denial, wyches
[64:16] more points, but effectively if I can't
[64:18] get you off of objectives, uh, you win.
[64:20] So my play this this turn is to table
[64:23] you.
[64:23] >> Okay.
[64:24] >> So [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red is staying exactly where he
[64:25] is. Um
[64:27] because I mean he would. And uh I'm
[64:32] going to start with a I'm going to start
[64:33] with Doombolt.
[64:34] >> Okay.
[64:34] >> Is your RJ Jack within 24 of me?
[64:36] >> Yes, he is.
[64:37] >> Yep. Cool. Doombolt.
[64:38] >> Doom bolt.
[64:39] >> Doom bolting. RJ.
[64:40] >> RJ.
[64:40] >> How many wounds do you have? Six. Three
[64:42] left.
[64:42] >> Three left.
[64:43] >> Poor fella.
[64:44] >> Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. I'm going
[64:47] to risk it for a bit here. He's got 12
[64:49] wounds. Yep. That is D3 plus three.
[64:51] >> He's dead.
[64:52] >> Arj is dead. Excellent.
[64:54] >> Or our Jack.
[64:54] >> Um let's then put Why not? Um Destiny's
[64:59] Ruin onto your
[65:02] >> [UNIT:Wolf Guard Terminators] and [UNIT:Logan Grimnar]
[65:03] now.
[65:06] >> Yes.
[65:08] >> Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I can [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] uh hit
[65:10] rolls of one against them.
[65:11] >> Okay.
[65:12] >> Wyches great cuz I'm [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red and I hit
[65:13] on twos.
[65:14] >> That is great.
[65:14] >> Uh I'm then going to put my gaze of
[65:16] [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red. I'm going to put all of my
[65:18] shooting. Am I going to put all of my
[65:19] shooting? Oh, there's a lot of
[65:21] [UNIT:Terminator Squad] there. I'm going to put the
[65:22] gaze of [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red into the Laidrader and
[65:25] I'm going to put the Firestorm because
[65:27] it's unlikely to weed you anyway
[65:29] >> into
[65:30] the [UNIT:Terminator Squad]
[65:35] of [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red. Three, four, five, six,
[65:37] seven.
[65:37] >> Okay.
[65:39] >> One, two, three, four.
[65:41] >> Twosip.
[65:45] >> Mhm.
[65:46] >> Toughness.
[65:47] Five
[65:49] >> of the Land Raider.
[65:50] >> Oh, 12. Sorry.
[65:54] >> Oh, that is a mighty good roll. So, two
[65:56] Debbies. Oh, it's not going to kill you
[65:58] though. Two two wounds.
[66:00] >> Two at oneus twous.
[66:02] >> You are getting cover.
[66:05] >> You butt.
[66:07] >> So, minus one.
[66:08] >> Yes.
[66:08] >> Yeah, they're both.
[66:09] >> Yep. Fine. You've taken six wounds. It's
[66:11] fine. You're a butt. It's okay. My
[66:14] firestorm.
[66:14] >> We got 10 wounds left.
[66:15] >> Shush. One, two.
[66:18] Three, four, five, six. Because there's
[66:20] lots in the unit.
[66:22] >> I hit you all the time.
[66:23] >> Okay.
[66:26] >> Toughness five. Oh my god. [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[66:28] >> Oh, [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[66:30] >> Bad.
[66:31] >> Okay.

[66:51] >> I'm gonna strike.
[66:52] >> Seven. Shush.
[66:54] >> Shush. Um, I'm also going to do uh the
[66:58] treason of Zech um rather than the minus
[67:00] one damage. I will tell you what that
[67:02] means in a minute.
[67:03] >> Okay.
[67:05] >> Doesn't make any difference right now,
[67:06] but do you know what does make a
[67:07] difference? Rolling three ones with
[67:08] [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red.
[67:09] >> You're still minus one damage, aren't
[67:11] you?
[67:11] >> No, that's why I'm changing.
[67:13] >> Okay.
[67:15] Devastating.
[67:17] And then three wounds. You've got the
[67:19] minus one to wound cuz you're turning.
[67:22] >> Yeah. Cuz I'm bigger. Cuz you're a big
[67:23] bully.
[67:24] >> One minus three.
[67:26] >> One of mine is still low.
[67:29] >> Minus three. Yeah. One. Yeah. One.
[67:31] >> Yeah. Two are dead.
[67:32] >> Two. Yeah.
[67:32] >> Yeah. Cuz why did God is devastating?
[67:34] >> Okay.
[67:35] >> Hit me back.
[67:36] >> Sure.
[67:37] >> Strike you back. I will.
[67:38] >> Yes.
[67:38] >> Mastercrafted power weapon.
[67:41] >> It is.
[67:41] >> So what Yoda you are? Yes. Uh, two
[67:45] lethal hits basically.
[67:46] >> Damn it.
[67:47] >> Minus two.
[67:50] >> Damn it.
[67:50] >> Okay.
[67:51] >> Damage
[67:51] >> two.
[67:52] >> Okay, he's down to 10.
[67:53] >> Okay. The powerful fist. Uh, two hits.
[67:59] No wounds. The relic. Great axe.
[68:06] >> No.
[68:07] >> [UNIT:Logan Grimnar] then. Is it?
[68:10] >> Yes. The axe. More kai. Six.
[68:14] Oh, you big muppet.
[68:17] >> Lethal.
[68:18] >> Two lethal hits.
[68:19] >> Is that it?
[68:20] >> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your horses
[68:22] there.
[68:24] >> Yes.
[68:24] >> Yeah, that's
[68:26] >> damage.
[68:27] >> Uh, damage is three
[68:28] >> each.
[68:29] >> Yeah.
[68:30] >> Uh, so that's six. So, I am down to four
[68:32] wings remaining, but [UNIT:Magnus the Red] The Red still
[68:33] stands.
[68:34] >> Oh,
[68:36] that does bring us to the end of my
[68:37] turn.
[68:38] >> Sure does. I will not get to pen
[68:39] stronghold because I went fully eat and
[68:41] I didn't quite achieve my area denial.
[68:44] And we have preemptively drawn your
[68:45] cards.
[68:46] >> I've drawn secure no man's land and
[68:48] assassination.
[68:49] >> Yeah. With with four wounds left.
[68:51] >> Yeah.
[68:53] >> Okay.
[68:54] >> Thank you. That was great.
[68:56] >> Really good fun. Really good fun. We're
[68:58] going to leave this battle
[68:59] >> eternal
[69:00] >> to your imagination because it deserves
[69:02] more than one more turn of combat
[69:04] really. And we don't want to see him
[69:06] kill Raider. the way the way you would
[69:09] you would fall back and shoot him with a
[69:10] L radider. That's just dull.
[69:11] >> That is dull.
[69:12] >> Dull as dull as hell.
[69:14] >> We're going to continue with the cinema
[69:15] and they will just fight forever more
[69:17] until Thousand Suns [STRATAGEM:Reinforcements] come.
[69:19] Space Wolf [STRATAGEM:Reinforcements] come. Rush
[69:21] shows up to save the 30th company from
[69:23] the big
[69:24] >> will go on until Games Workshop releases
[69:26] the new Rust model.
[69:27] >> Yeah.
[69:27] >> Whenever that's happening.
[69:28] >> We return 727.
[69:32] They're still going. Um yeah, that was
[69:34] great. I really have a lot of love for
[69:36] the [FACTION:Space Wolves]. There's something
[69:38] about which I do quite like. Um I
[69:40] probably misplayed a few times including
[69:42] the wolf the whole [UNIT:Wulfen] debacle.
[69:45] >> We might talk about that.
[69:46] >> I think smaller [UNIT:Wulfen] units probably
[69:48] make more sense as well rather than just
[69:50] yeeting 10 [UNIT:Wulfen] towards
[69:52] >> they're quite a lucrative target because
[69:55] they're quite scary.
[69:56] >> Yeah. So I
[69:58] >> what's funny is that both the the 10
[70:00] block of [UNIT:Wulfen] and the 20 uh blood
[70:02] claws didn't even swing.
[70:04] >> Yeah.
[70:05] >> In that game
[70:05] >> and you still won.
[70:07] >> Well, they sort of did stuff to do
[70:08] things. It's not all about fighting.
[70:10] >> You definitely you definitely uh you
[70:12] herded me. That's what they were. They
[70:13] were sheep dogs.
[70:14] >> Got to use your brain muscles as well as
[70:16] your your body muscles and your your
[70:19] your brain sword, not just your
[70:21] chainsaw.
