[0:00] We've finally made it. I have come a
[0:02] long way. I have been running through
[0:05] the entire gauntlet at Playon Studios.
[0:08] Fought against Mubin. I've fought
[0:10] against Nick. I've fought against JT.
[0:13] Against T'au, which a lot of people
[0:16] thought was the boss,
[0:19] the one who signs my paychecks.
[0:22] I'm Tac, co-founder, owner, CEO, and
[0:24] president of Play Tabletop. And thus I
[0:27] am the boss fight for Mitchell's final
[0:29] commentary.
[0:30] >> Greetings 40k fans and welcome to this
[0:32] episode of 40k in 40 minutes. Your host
[0:34] JT the voice here hot machi. Have we got
[0:37] a good one today. Codex compliance is a
[0:40] touchy subject with many space marine
[0:41] chapters. The [FACTION:Black Templars] have been
[0:43] on crusade for over 10,000 years. A
[0:46] codeex loophole that allows them to
[0:47] maintain a fighting force well beyond
[0:49] the ascribed 1,000 space marines set out
[0:51] by the author of the CEX Rab Roboute Guilliman.
[0:53] Roboute Guilliman and Grimaldus Helbrecht are having a
[0:56] collaborative discussion. I agreed to a
[0:59] little meet up with Roboute Guilliman himself.
[1:02] >> It seems today he looks to close that
[1:04] loophole with extreme prejudice. Talks
[1:07] have broken down and there's nothing
[1:08] left but war.
[1:10] >> Mitchell and his raffle procession Black
[1:12] Templars face the final challenge in his
[1:14] gauntlet as Tac takes the field with his
[1:17] first company Task Force Ultramarines as
[1:19] his final boss level. I wonder if T gets
[1:22] to revive three times and then play
[1:23] classical music. That'd be cool.
[1:25] >> Mitchell has been an amazing addition to
[1:27] our team and we met on a fateful day at
[1:29] a tournament.
[1:30] >> He said that he would give me the job at
[1:32] play on as a painter if I could beat
[1:35] him. With the pressure on, I proceeded
[1:38] to lose that game. Pretty sure it was
[1:41] like an 8020.
[1:43] >> However, I really did want him to join
[1:45] the team and offered him the job anyway.
[1:47] >> Thanks, D.
[1:48] >> You're welcome. I am very excited about
[1:50] the list I'm bringing because I finally
[1:52] get to play first company. And I know
[1:54] there's a lot of criticism around this
[1:56] detachment, but it's thematic. It's got
[1:58] some fun strategims and I'm bringing a
[2:00] lot of veterans.
[2:01] >> Tax Ultramarines. First Company task
[2:03] force consists of Sicarius.
[2:05] >> Can't be a boss fight without Roboute Guilliman on
[2:07] the judiciar. There's an enhancement
[2:09] called fear made manifest. If infantry
[2:11] units fails battleshock around them,
[2:12] lose a model. Once per game, I can make
[2:15] that D3 models. a chaplain in terminator squad
[2:17] armor, chief librarian tigurius. He's
[2:20] got a fiveman intercessor squad, a
[2:21] six-man bladeguard veteran squad, five
[2:24] scouts, a 10-man sternguard veteran squad veteran
[2:26] squad, and a fiveman sternguard veteran squad,
[2:28] a fiveman terminator squad assault squad with
[2:30] thunder hammers, and five terminator squad squad
[2:31] with lightning claws. He's also got six
[2:34] Victrix Honor Guard.
[2:35] >> I am looking to put the Templar back in
[2:38] their place.
[2:39] >> I have brought my [FACTION:Black Templars]. I am
[2:41] using my favorite detachment, wrathful
[2:44] procession. Course of relentless hate
[2:47] gives me plus two movement and plus one
[2:50] advance on every infantry and mountain.
[2:53] It's insane. In this army list, I have
[2:55] brought two dreadnought,
[2:58] Castellan, an the emperor's champion, high
[2:59] marshal grimaldus helbrecht, a judiciar, and a
[3:01] fiveman intercessor squad. He's got a
[3:03] three-man bladeguard veteran squad,
[3:05] three out rididers, a repulsor
[3:06] repulsor executioner, and a fiveman terminator squad
[3:08] squad. Han Veling, the combi weapon
[3:11] lieutenant. He sniffs out psykers.
[3:13] Tigurius being around is not good. He
[3:16] hates him.
[3:16] >> Today's mission is [OBJECTIVE:Terraform]. From the
[3:18] second round onwards, at the end of
[3:19] every command phase or the end of round
[3:20] five, if they win second, the player
[3:22] whose turn it will score four victory
[3:23] points for each objective marker they
[3:25] control, one or more units, each within
[3:26] range of a different objective marker
[3:28] not within their deployment zone, may
[3:29] attempt to [OBJECTIVE:Terraform] objectives. From
[3:31] the second round onwards, at the end of
[3:32] every player turn, they'll score a
[3:34] victory point for each objective marker
[3:35] that they've terraformed. Welcome to
[3:37] Armageddon and your final boss fight. Y
[3:40] >> I feel like the real boss was T'au. Like
[3:43] he's like in those video games the
[3:45] actual like really powerful side boss.
[3:47] >> He's just a bigger scarier guy that's
[3:48] just a quick time event that you just
[3:50] butt mash through. Yeah.
[3:51] >> Now I'm willing to put on the line if
[3:53] you win the authorization of the budget
[3:56] to get the whole paint studio redone as
[3:59] a hobby and shoot space.
[4:01] >> That's what I'm willing to put on.
[4:02] >> Wow. And if you win, I'll shave my
[4:06] mustache.
[4:08] I don't know if we want to do that, do
[4:10] we?
[4:15] We are playing on a beautiful thematic
[4:18] board. So, we are not playing kind of
[4:20] standard layout. We are playing on a
[4:21] sweeping engagement. And let's see
[4:26] you deploy first.
[4:27] >> I have one infiltrate classic handsing.
[4:29] He could smell toas a mile away.
[4:33] What I really want to do with my
[4:34] infiltrators is actually block out your
[4:36] ability to get up the board. So, I'm
[4:38] going to let you deploy everything else
[4:39] before I put my infiltrators on. My
[4:41] first drop is going to be a set of
[4:44] intercessor squad.
[4:46] >> And I am basically going to do the exact
[4:49] same thing.
[4:50] >> Terminator squad squad.
[4:53] >> Big bad bladeguard veteran squad are in my
[4:56] um repulsor repulsor executioner
[4:58] >> eradicator squad.
[5:00] So naturally, I'm going to put my
[5:01] dreadnought there.
[5:03] >> Serard vets and they're going to go in
[5:05] this corner here in a line.
[5:07] >> My The Emperor's Champion right here behind
[5:09] a wall.
[5:10] >> Vicious Honor Guard with Ko Securius.
[5:13] >> I might have to do my other big
[5:16] dreadnought.
[5:17] >> These are my scouts. They're just going
[5:18] to deploy outside of my line here.
[5:20] >> Spikes are going to go here. I kind of
[5:22] want them to screen my dreadnought.
[5:24] >> I'm going to take my blade drive
[5:25] reference, hide behind this ruin. I'm
[5:27] going to put a 10-man crusader squad
[5:30] right here behind the building. And this
[5:32] has the execrator in it.
[5:33] >> Roboute Guilliman gets thrown up 12. Oh, I'm all
[5:36] out of drops. That is the sword
[5:38] brethren. There's a Castellan and a
[5:40] Marshal attached to it. And now the
[5:42] angriest one of them all. Hell, and a
[5:46] full 10-man crusader squad in this
[5:49] corner. Everything deployed now.
[5:52] >> Mitchell Scott, he has terminator squad squad in
[5:53] Dstrike. I'm fully deployed and
[5:55] realizing how elite my army is yet
[5:57] again.
[5:58] >> In reserves, Tax got his turn guard
[5:59] veteran squad with the chief librarian
[6:01] Tigurius attached. Tax got his
[6:03] Terminator Squad Assault Squad with joint
[6:04] chaplain also in deep strike. Those are
[6:06] the lightning claw Terminator Squad Squad. There's
[6:08] a lot of camite and faith in the emperor
[6:10] here. I'm wondering if righteous zeal
[6:13] will win out or will the author of the
[6:15] Codex of Stardies prove its value? This

[7:04] >> Do you want to go first or second?
[7:06] >> Second.
[7:06] >> I definitely want to go second as well.
[7:08] >> You come to me and then I'll charge you.
[7:11] >> Six. Oh no.
[7:12] >> Yeah, I have to go first.
[7:14] >> Best of luck.
[7:16] Looks like T's going to be going first.
[7:18] He places his teleport homer for his
[7:19] terminator squad squad on that left side objective.
[7:21] That's going to allow the deep striking
[7:22] terminator squad squad to [STRATAGEM:Rapid Ingress] there for
[7:24] free. That has come in at the end of
[7:26] Mitchell's movement phase. Mitchell
[7:28] places his teleport homer near the
[7:29] midboard again. Same thing.
[7:36] Mitchell choosing his Templar vow at the
[7:38] start of round one. It'll be accept any
[7:39] challenge no matter the odds. That's
[7:41] going to give him plus one to wound in
[7:43] melee if his strength is lower than or
[7:45] equal to the target toughness. That is
[7:47] good. Mitchell chooses his zealous
[7:49] litany as well. He'll have to choose
[7:51] this every round. I doubt it changes to
[7:53] be honest. He's going to go with chorus
[7:54] of relentless hate. Plus 2in move and
[7:56] plus one in advance to infantry and
[7:57] mounted units of which he's got a few.
[8:00] Finally, the lieutenant chooses his
[8:01] priority objective identified. That's
[8:03] going to give rroll ones to wound on it
[8:04] as long as the combi lieutenant's alive.
[8:06] >> All right, so secondaries. Secondaries
[8:08] are going to be
[8:09] >> both players pick up a command point
[8:11] tack draw [OBJECTIVE:Sabotage] and [OBJECTIVE:No Prisoners].
[8:12] >> Yep, that's a rough turn one draw.
[8:15] >> Gleman's author of the CEX ability here
[8:17] choosing two abilities. Master of Battle
[8:19] for a second [STRATAGEM:Oath of Moment] target and
[8:20] supreme strategist to give him a reduced
[8:22] cost strategy use within 12 in. I
[8:24] imagine he's going to have that the
[8:26] entire game. [STRATAGEM:Oath of Moment] target
[8:27] number one is the outr rididers. Oath of
[8:29] target number two will be the sword
[8:30] brethren.
[8:30] >> I need to kill the first [STRATAGEM:Oath of Moment]
[8:32] target for it to transfer to the second.
[8:33] If you don't get your bikes killed then
[8:35] I won't have [STRATAGEM:Oath of Moment] on your
[8:36] sword brother. Interesting. And then
[8:38] last but not least, I will sticky my
[8:40] home objective.
[8:41] >> Tax's going to maintain control over it
[8:43] even if he isn't on it until Mitchell
[8:44] takes it away.
[8:45] >> Okay, so then we go into the moon phase.
[8:47] >> Assault Charminators advance to the left
[8:49] objective. Intercessor Squad advance 11 in in
[8:52] beside the scout squad now with a bead
[8:53] on the out riders. Bladeguard Veteran Squad
[8:55] and the jiu-jitsu are moved to fill the
[8:56] gap left by the intercessor squad.
[8:57] >> So we're good. That is all the movement.
[8:59] We go into the shooting phase. I'm going
[9:01] to take my scouts and they're going to
[9:02] start the [OBJECTIVE:Sabotage] action.
[9:04] >> Intercessor Squad shoot the out rididers.
[9:05] Only one wounded and he's got one wound
[9:07] left
[9:08] >> and that's all she wrote for my turn.
[9:10] >> Not a huge turn for tack. Both players
[9:12] still have a command point. No points
[9:13] scored yet. [OBJECTIVE:Sabotage] is ongoing and no
[9:15] prisoners is kept in his pocket. On
[9:17] mental turn one.
[9:27] Don't have any command face things which
[9:29] this is the first time I haven't brought
[9:30] a techmarine and I'm very I miss him.
[9:34] I will take
[9:36] >> Mitchell pulls storm hostile objective
[9:38] and secure no man's land.
[9:39] >> These are both great.
[9:40] >> Oh, you got really good draws.
[9:41] >> Yeah. So, why don't I So, I need to move
[9:44] Van Helsing.
[9:45] >> Lieutenant moves on top of the crate.
[9:48] Sword Brethren with the Marshal and
[9:49] Castellan close on the Terminator Squad Squad.
[9:50] Redemptor Dreadnought in behind the Sword
[9:52] Brethren and Champion in beside
[9:54] the objective. Ballistus Dreadnought
[9:55] advances to the right objective.
[9:57] Outrider Squad advance onto the right
[9:59] objective.
[10:01] Bladeguard Veteran Squad disembark the
[10:03] Repulsor Repulsor Executioner and move onto his
[10:05] home. Repulsor Repulsor Executioner in behind the
[10:09] intercessor squad.
[10:12] Crusader Squad advances behind the
[10:15] crates.
[10:16] >> Let's do some shooting, shall we?
[10:18] [STRATAGEM:Grenade].
[10:20] It's on force. Not bad. Three of them.
[10:22] >> Terminator Squad down to a single wound
[10:24] remaining.
[10:24] >> Redemptor Dreadnought firing on the
[10:26] terminator squad squad. Only two wounds. takes out
[10:28] the wounded one and puts a wound on one
[10:30] more.
[10:31] >> I'm not going to shoot my sword brethren
[10:32] at them. I don't want to risk killing a
[10:34] guy cuz that will make that charge
[10:36] almost impossible.
[10:37] >> Copy lieutenant now terraforming the
[10:39] objective.
[10:40] Charge phase sword brethren in charge of
[10:42] terminator squad squad.
[10:42] >> If he makes his charge, Terminator Squad Squad are
[10:44] in trouble. If he makes his charge and
[10:46] gets more objective control on that
[10:47] objective, I lose it and he gets a
[10:49] [OBJECTIVE:Terraform]. These sword brethren should
[10:51] make short work of these terminator squad squad. I
[10:53] just have to make a 9-in charge. I make
[10:55] these all the time. It should be no
[10:56] problem. Come on.
[11:00] I rolled an eight.
[11:02] >> I dodged a bullet. Well, technically I
[11:04] dodged a sword.
[11:05] >> I'm staring at terminator squad squad that are
[11:07] close enough for a counter charge.
[11:09] >> That's really not good. Well, Jack
[11:11] [OBJECTIVE:Sabotage] complete. So, that's going to
[11:12] give him three points on his secondaries
[11:13] to give him three. Storm hostile
[11:15] objective is being discarded by
[11:17] Mitchell. He's going to gain him a
[11:18] command point. He is going to score two
[11:20] points on secure no man's land. That's
[11:22] going to put our score 3 to2 at the end
[11:23] of battle round one in favor of TAC. And
[11:26] now I get to dictate the action. On to
[11:29] turn two.
[11:42] I draw secondaries and I'm going to draw
[11:44] here. T draws [OBJECTIVE:Overwhelming Force] to add
[11:46] to [OBJECTIVE:No Prisoners].
[11:47] >> This is perfect. I get to kill things on
[11:49] objectives. Mitchell has rambunctiously
[11:51] run out and put himself on a whole bunch
[11:53] of objectives. giving me a plethora of
[11:56] options to kill.
[11:57] >> Oath Target one will be the crusaders
[11:58] with the X crater. Oath Target two will
[12:00] be the sword brethren. Attack holds one
[12:02] objective to score four primary points
[12:04] taking him up to seven. It's not
[12:06] actually a go turn yet just cuz I'm not
[12:08] in a prime position for go turn.
[12:10] >> Victrix Honour Guard with Sicarius
[12:12] closed on the outr rididers. Terminator Squad Squad
[12:14] move further onto the objective. Evade
[12:15] and survive triggered on the lieutenant.
[12:17] He retreats towards Hellburg's unit.
[12:19] Eradicator Squad advance into the ruins.
[12:21] >> Your tank catches me. Intercessor Squad move
[12:24] to gain a better field of fire. Blade
[12:25] guard veterans advancing 12 to be
[12:27] between the intercessor squad and the scouts.
[12:30] G moves beside the bladeguard veteran squad.
[12:32] Turn guard veterans move up.
[12:34] >> That is it for movement and then we're
[12:35] going to go into the river step.
[12:36] >> Lightning Claw terminator squad squad with
[12:38] chaplain. Deep striking in behind the
[12:40] Thunderhammer. Terminator Squad Squad. Turn guard
[12:42] veteran squad with Tyigerious arrive
[12:43] just to the right. Attacks objective.
[12:45] >> What is he doing here?
[12:47] >> We could be friends, you know. On to the
[12:49] shooting phase. And I really want to
[12:51] make all of my shots count.
[12:52] >> Command mode here for duty and honor.
[12:53] The sternguard veteran squad with Tigurius will get
[12:55] plus one to hit. Going into the oath
[12:57] crusaders. Two space marines fail their
[12:59] saves. Mitchell using fueled by wrath
[13:01] here for a command point for a five up
[13:02] field of pain versus the mortal wounds
[13:04] that he's about to receive. Still loses
[13:06] four more models. There's four left in
[13:08] the unit. Intercessor Squad using grenades
[13:10] for zero command points. Thanks to
[13:12] Gullin.
[13:13] >> You're hugging a holy hand [STRATAGEM:Grenade]. I'm
[13:15] hugging a pineapple surprise. Pineapple
[13:17] surprise. One neopight is down.
[13:20] >> My intercessor squad are going to unload into
[13:23] your crusaders.
[13:24] >> Two initiates and a neopight down.
[13:26] >> So you still got two and your character
[13:29] >> element into the crusader squad. One
[13:31] more model down.
[13:32] >> My victric can all see into that squad
[13:35] and they're going to take their master
[13:36] crafted carbines into you. Trying to
[13:38] take out your last power disc.
[13:41] Hit on twos. Re-rolling
[13:43] everything good. I'm wounding on threes.
[13:46] Drop two. So that is a total of six.
[13:49] >> Cool. I'm just going to take them all at
[13:50] the same two damage each. Oh god,
[13:54] >> they're all dead.
[13:55] >> Command Point to roll a save from
[13:56] Mitchell. JUST THE Execrator SURVIVES
[13:58] with two wounds left.
[14:00] >> The reason why this is huge and I don't
[14:02] get ultra moment on there. It's a really
[14:03] good spend.
[14:04] >> Five-Man Sternguard into the sword
[14:05] brethren. Just a wound. Lightning Claw
[14:08] terminator squad squad [OBJECTIVE:Terraform] that left side
[14:10] objective.
[14:11] >> Then we go into the charge phase.
[14:12] >> Kosaras and the Victrix charge the outr
[14:14] rididers and they fail. Command Point
[14:16] [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll]. He's in.
[14:20] Thunderhammer Terminator Squad's charging the
[14:21] sword, brethren. They fail.
[14:23] >> That's a double one. You got
[14:27] finally something's going right. You
[14:30] reuse your command point.
[14:32] >> That was rough.
[14:34] >> Yeah, that's really rough. That's
[14:35] really, really rough.
[14:37] >> Big honor guard and KO into the out
[14:39] rididers now. Mitchell with a command
[14:41] point for armor of contempt on the out
[14:42] rididers.
[14:42] >> We're going to start off with the blades
[14:43] of honor. Hitting on twos. Wounding on
[14:46] fours. Twin link.
[14:48] >> On fours. Let's go. Two. Go through.
[14:51] >> Kills one and one's got two ones left.
[14:52] And then here are the others that can
[14:54] fight.
[14:56] >> Yep. You live. Oh yeah, only three.
[15:00] >> One survives.
[15:01] No effect on the clap back from the out
[15:03] rider bike.
[15:04] >> So that was a really bad turn for me.
[15:05] >> [OBJECTIVE:Overwhelming Force] is kept by T. No
[15:07] prisoner scored for two. That gives him
[15:09] five on his secondaries. He does get a
[15:10] [OBJECTIVE:Terraform] to add to his primary. 10
[15:13] points to Mitchell's two.
[15:15] >> It's about to get steamy in here.
[15:17] >> HR,
[15:19] it's my turn. I'm going to draw my
[15:22] secondaries. Are you ready for this?
[15:24] >> Pixel's pulled. Bring It Down and
[15:25] establish Locust.
[15:26] >> You don't have any monsters vehicles. Is
[15:28] that a monster?
[15:29] >> Yes,
[15:30] >> it is a monster. So, I can't discard
[15:32] that. Great. Next is scoring. I have one
[15:34] objective.
[15:34] >> One objective held for four points takes
[15:36] him up to six.
[15:38] >> Now, on to the movement phase. And then
[15:40] I've heard rumblings that you're going
[15:42] to try some shenanigans.
[15:43] >> X crater moves. Tigeria squad with a
[15:45] zero command point. [STRATAGEM:Fire Overwatch]. No
[15:46] damage.
[15:49] >> The Emperor's Champion. So they're going to
[15:51] go side by side spreading their hatred.
[15:54] They're going to they're going to frolic
[15:56] hands in hands. Excrader kind of looks
[15:57] like he's doing like a little like I
[16:00] don't know.
[16:00] >> Murder.
[16:04] >> Redemptor moves up to the wall under the
[16:07] Thunderhammer Terminator Squad Squad. Sword Brother
[16:08] advancing towards the repulsor
[16:10] repulsor executioner. Not enough command point to
[16:12] [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] the advance. Close enough to
[16:14] embark the repulsor executioner now.
[16:18] Helbrute and his crusaders move the
[16:19] left objective. Repulsor Repulsor Executioner
[16:22] adjusts slightly. Intercessor Squad into the
[16:24] middle. Outrider falls back into cover.
[16:27] >> Okay, so let's just start off with the
[16:29] important thing.
[16:30] >> Repulsor Repulsor Executioner opening up with the
[16:32] fiveman stir guard. They gone.
[16:34] Intercessor Squad establish locust in the
[16:37] midboard. Uh, Crusader Squad here
[16:39] shooting at the lightning claws. So,
[16:40] let's start with Hellre. Uh, comi
[16:43] weapon.
[16:43] >> Hell.
[16:44] >> Hell. I was burping at the same time.
[16:46] Two shots. Misses once. Uh, this a
[16:49] strength five on fours. No. But I do
[16:52] have a whole bunch of pistols.
[16:56] >> I'm okay.
[16:57] >> Regular bolt pistols. Yeah,
[17:01] >> I'm okay. Terminate armor.
[17:03] >> Red dreadnought. Fires of the lightning
[17:05] cloud. Terminator Squad Squad. One damage only,
[17:07] leaving a terminator squad with two wounds
[17:09] remaining.
[17:09] >> Speaking of charges, let's do that.
[17:11] >> Charge face now. Redemptor Dreadnought charges
[17:14] the Thunderhammer Terminator Squad Squad. He's in.
[17:16] Hell and his crusaders charge the
[17:18] Thunderhammer Terminator Squad Squad
[17:19] >> this time. It's not a 9-in charge, so
[17:21] hopefully this will be better.
[17:24] >> They fail. This zone here is a no charge
[17:28] zone. Internet, we're both really bad at
[17:30] charging.
[17:32] >> Execrator into the Vic Honor Guard.
[17:34] Success. The Emperor's Champion into the
[17:36] Vicrix. He's in. Ballistus Dreadnought charges the
[17:39] Victrix Honour Guard. OH, MORTALS OF THE
[17:41] CHARGE.
[17:43] >> Does it fail completely on a one?
[17:44] >> Yes.
[17:45] >> Oh, knowing you have two command points.
[17:48] I'm going to start with the Emperor's
[17:50] Champion.
[17:51] >> Precision on his weapon. Going to try to
[17:53] snipe out Sicarius.
[17:55] >> Cararius are going to have a fight to
[17:56] the death. The The Emperor's Champion is
[17:58] going to claim that he is the better
[18:00] swordsman. I am going to elect to use my
[18:03] once per game devastating wounds.
[18:05] Hitting on twos, wounding on threes.
[18:07] Fives are devs.
[18:10] Ooh, two devs and two wounds. Three
[18:13] damage each. HE GOT HIM. AND HE WOUNDED
[18:16] ONE OF THE victrix honour guard.
[18:17] >> I have lost my captain, so I'm no longer
[18:19] minus one.
[18:19] >> Taxing two command points on counter
[18:21] offensive here. Tarding the victrix
[18:23] guard. The execrator goes down.
[18:26] >> The unyielding has yielded. Emperor's
[18:29] Champion has to parry to survive.
[18:31] Ballistus Dreadnought now into the Victrix.
[18:33] One dies and another is left with a
[18:35] wound. Dreadnought has to pass Battleshock
[18:37] test for being in combat with his
[18:38] terminator squad squad and it succeeds. Redemptor
[18:40] Dread into Thunderhammer Terminator Squad Squad.
[18:41] One down, another wounded. Terminator Squad Squad
[18:43] fight back. Redemptor to 10 wounds left.
[18:46] Scouts go back into strategic reserve.
[18:48] Wow, what a lot of action on that turn.
[18:50] Mitchell established Locust for two.
[18:52] That puts him to four secondary, four
[18:54] primary for eight. attack does actually
[18:56] score [OBJECTIVE:Overwhelming Force] on Mitchell's
[18:57] turn. Plus, he's got another [OBJECTIVE:Terraform].
[18:58] Takes it to 14. 148 as we hit the tax
[19:01] turn three.
[19:15] >> Author of the Codeex. I'm going to go
[19:16] command point spend as well as double O.
[19:18] >> Bring It Down and display a lighter
[19:20] drawn. [STRATAGEM:Oath of Moment] on the dreadnought
[19:23] first and ultim moment number two is
[19:24] going to be on hell's unit. We're
[19:26] Warhammer players and we don't learn our
[19:28] lessons.
[19:29] >> We're just going to try again.
[19:32] >> Tackles three objectives to score 12 big
[19:34] points on primary.
[19:36] >> So the fun thing is if I'm able to kill
[19:37] that dreadnought in shooting that will free
[19:39] me up to actually make a terminator squad
[19:41] charge. So that's what we're going to
[19:42] try really, really, really hard to do.
[19:44] >> Eradicator Squad lining up on the redempter
[19:46] dread. Lightning Claw. Terminator Squad Squad move
[19:48] towards Helbrute and the Crusaders.
[19:50] Lieutenant reacting here with evade and
[19:51] survive. He's in behind the runes now to
[19:53] the right of Grimaldus Helbrecht. The bladeguard veteran squad
[19:55] do a shuffle. Sternguard Veteran Squad and Tigurius
[19:57] advance to the runes. Roboute Guilliman in behind
[20:00] the Vic honor guard. Intercessor Squad moving
[20:02] towards the repulsor. Repulsor Executioner.
[20:03] [STRATAGEM:Fire Overwatch] is for a command point.
[20:06] >> Defensive array shooting offensively.
[20:10] >> Four this time.
[20:11] >> Okay.
[20:12] >> Hey, you don't have to overperform.
[20:14] >> One.
[20:14] >> Three plus. I'm okay. Icorus rocket pod.
[20:20] >> Nope. The multimelta.
[20:24] Uh, let's shoot the laser. This is not
[20:26] working.
[20:27] >> No, it's not working.
[20:29] >> Yay. One laser.
[20:33] >> Yeah.
[20:33] >> Can I make a six?
[20:36] >> OH MY GOODNESS.
[20:37] >> WHAT ON EARTH? NO.
[20:39] >> Intercessor Squad take barely any damage. He
[20:42] got half of a guy. He shot one of his
[20:43] hearts.
[20:44] >> Wish I got some more guys. Victrix,
[20:46] honor guard, fall back, touching the
[20:48] wall. Scout Squad returns to the back of
[20:50] tax deployment zone.
[20:52] >> And I have a missile launcher looking at
[20:53] a dreadnought.
[20:55] That might be the shot. And then now,
[20:57] would you like to rapidress?
[20:58] >> Mitchell, the command point to rapid
[21:00] ingress's terminator squad squad. They drop in
[21:01] front of his lieutenant.
[21:04] >> All right, so here we go. We're going to
[21:06] my shooting phase.
[21:07] >> Eradicator Squad firing at the redemptor,
[21:09] leaving it with five wounds remaining.
[21:11] Scout Squad shoots the redemptor. No
[21:13] wounds. I owe the moment incorrectly.
[21:15] >> Intercessor Squad on Intercessor Squad. One goes
[21:18] down, another on a wound.
[21:19] >> Oh no. So that's a charge now.
[21:21] >> Yellow into the The Emperor's Champion. Down
[21:23] to three wounds even with his parry.
[21:27] >> We are back to charging.
[21:29] >> Charge phase. Lightning Claw.
[21:30] Terminator Squad Squad into Hellbreak and his
[21:32] crusader squad.
[21:33] >> We are going to debunk.
[21:35] >> We're going to debunk the uh the Tigurius
[21:37] theory.
[21:37] >> We are finally going to make a charge
[21:39] through that lane.
[21:40] >> I believe in you, Tac.
[21:41] >> Here we go.
[21:42] >> I believe in you.
[21:44] We make a charge WITH THE LID.
[21:46] >> YOU GET it with a dile. Oh my god.
[21:49] Success.
[21:52] >> Bladeguard Veteran Squad charging
[21:54] intercessor squad fail.
[21:55] >> Roboute Guilliman's free ability to uh do it to the
[21:58] bladeguard veteran squad cuz I'm still within
[21:59] 12.
[22:00] >> Still fails.
[22:01] >> Yes.
[22:02] >> Up by one.
[22:03] >> Roboute Guilliman and The Emperor's Champion. He fails.
[22:06] >> So Empress Champion is just there.
[22:08] >> Sick.
[22:09] >> Intercessor Squad charge the Repulsor
[22:11] repulsor executioner. HE'S MAD. MAD, I TELL YOU.
[22:14] >> SIX.
[22:16] >> That's an eight. They've stuffed your
[22:18] tank.
[22:21] >> And then we go into the uh fighting
[22:23] >> force battle shock on Hellre's unit. And
[22:25] it fails. Dreadnought passes. However,
[22:28] >> I will do a little Hellre yelling.
[22:33] >> Yeah,
[22:37] I don't know what that WAS FOR THE
[22:39] EMPEROR. HELL'S HIGH Marshal ABILITY
[22:42] DOES four mortal wounds to the
[22:43] terminator squad squad. ONE Terminator Squad DIES AND
[22:46] ANOTHER to two wounds left. Tax spends a
[22:48] command point here on heroes of the
[22:49] chapter. It's going to give the
[22:50] lightning claw terminator squad squad plus one hit
[22:52] and the crusader squad. Oo, eight models
[22:55] down
[22:55] >> and one wound on a power fist.
[22:58] >> Red dreadnought fights the thunderhammer
[23:00] terminator squad squad. One down, one wounded.
[23:02] Thunderhammer's hit back. One damage
[23:05] only. Takes it to four wounds remaining.
[23:07] The remaining crusader squad and hell go
[23:08] to the lightning cloud terminator squad squad.
[23:10] Three remain. The repulsor repulsor executioner
[23:13] kills an intercessor.
[23:14] >> You didn't get him in shooting, but you
[23:16] did finally get him. You know what? With
[23:17] that failed charge, I actually gave you
[23:19] back the objective. So, that was a dumb
[23:20] move on my part.
[23:21] >> Tax kept bringing it down. Discarding
[23:22] display of might, so no more secondary
[23:24] points for him. He will have one command
[23:25] point at the end of the turn and a total
[23:27] of 27 points to Mitchell's eight.
[23:29] >> I did not score any of my secondaries.
[23:31] That was pretty bad. I'm in a good board
[23:33] position, but I'm in a very good
[23:35] position to be counterattacked.
[23:52] All right, time for a command point.
[23:55] >> I go to two.
[23:56] >> Do secondaries display. Defend
[23:59] stronghold.
[24:00] >> Intercessor Squad now exert their objective
[24:02] secured over that center objective.
[24:04] He'll hold that until Tack takes it
[24:05] away, even if he's not on it. Then I
[24:08] have to do some BS
[24:12] as in Battleshock.
[24:13] >> Redemptor Dreadnought passes Battleshock.
[24:15] Hellback's Crusader Squad passes
[24:17] Battleshock. Mitchell holds three
[24:19] objectives for 12 victory points. He
[24:21] sits at 20 to tax 27.
[24:23] >> So now he's going to kill some Vicatrix
[24:26] Guard.
[24:26] >> Okay.
[24:27] >> Ballistus Dreadnought Dread closes on the Vicrix
[24:28] Guard. Outrider onto the right side
[24:30] objective. Turner squad closing on
[24:33] eradicator squad.
[24:36] Lieutenant towards the left objective.
[24:38] >> No, down here.
[24:40] >> Intercessor Squad towards tax blade
[24:42] guard. Sword Brother, disembark from the
[24:44] repulsor repulsor executioner and move to the
[24:45] center objective. Bladeguard veteran,
[24:47] move towards the repulsor repulsor executioner
[24:49] and embark. A little transport dosey-do.
[24:52] My moving is done. This thing is going
[24:54] to shoot. My repulsor repulsor executioner is
[24:56] going to shoot these intercessor squad right
[24:58] point blank in combat. Big cannon. That
[25:00] four missed, but I [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll].
[25:03] Still missed. Ph. That's a one. Uh,
[25:06] multi melta
[25:09] >> [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] hits. Two hits.
[25:13] >> One wound. Uh, AP4 goes right through.
[25:15] >> Oh, it's uh, it's a dead guy. Yeah.
[25:17] Heavy bolter.
[25:20] >> Mick.
[25:21] >> Icorus. Rocket pod.
[25:24] One hits. Rerolls into two hits.
[25:27] Strength eight. Two wounds. AP one.
[25:31] >> Make one.
[25:31] >> Fail one. So that's another one dead.
[25:33] >> There are two left. Yes.
[25:34] >> Shot. So, defensive array. Oh. Oh, no.
[25:40] >> This could do it.
[25:42] >> I'm okay.
[25:43] >> Stubbber. Butt stubber.
[25:46] >> I'm okay.
[25:47] >> Heavy gat.
[25:50] >> Threes. There we go. There's four devs.
[25:53] That's it. That's just enough.
[25:55] >> Repulsor into the intercessor squad on its
[25:57] hull. Got them.
[25:58] >> I'm going to melt the gunman in the
[26:00] face.
[26:01] >> Ballistus Dreadnought dread to gullin. No damage. Ah,
[26:05] >> Intercessor Squad into Bladeg Guard
[26:07] Veterans. One down.
[26:08] >> Oh, nice. Nice.
[26:10] >> Terminator Squad Squad into the Eradicator Squad.
[26:12] Eradicator takes a wound. Redemptor
[26:13] Dreadnought into the Thunderhammer
[26:15] Terminator Squad Squad. Just the injured Terminator Squad
[26:17] dies. Ooh, it's okay. I'm going to punch
[26:20] him. Outrider terraforms. Sword Brother
[26:22] [OBJECTIVE:Terraform].
[26:23] >> Double [OBJECTIVE:Terraform]. It's happening. Let's
[26:27] first charge.
[26:29] >> The Emperor's Champion with the
[26:31] multi-charge. Victrix Honour Guard and
[26:33] Roboute Guilliman. He's in. Ballistus Dreadnought
[26:36] charges the Victrix Honour Guard. Three
[26:38] mortal wounds on the Bratalis charge.
[26:40] Mitchell spends a command point here on
[26:41] [STRATAGEM:Tank Shock]. Two more mortal wounds to
[26:43] the Victrix Honour Guard. That's two Victrix
[26:45] Honor Guard down in the charge phase.
[26:49] Terminator Squad Squad into eradicator squad. Fail.
[26:51] >> That's okay. I kind of knew that one was
[26:53] a risk.
[26:54] >> Lieutenant Thunderhammer. Terminator Squad.
[26:56] He's in. Shank you before you hammer me.
[26:59] That's all of my charges. At the start
[27:01] of the fight phase, uh, Hellre says,
[27:03] "Hello,
[27:04] >> fight."
[27:06] >> Hell, four mortal wounds from his high
[27:07] marshal ability into the lightning claw
[27:10] terminator squad squad. One model dies and another
[27:11] is left with a single wound remaining.
[27:13] Redemptor fails its battle shock because
[27:15] it's in combat with the assault
[27:16] intercessor squad. Lieutenant also fails
[27:17] battleshock. Those terminator squad squad are scary
[27:20] AF. Boy,
[27:21] >> you have enough to interrupt.
[27:22] >> Yep. I have two command points. I'm
[27:25] declaring my The Emperor's Champion is
[27:27] attacking at Roboute Guilliman.
[27:29] Here we go. On twos.
[27:32] Oh no, I'm mooning on force.
[27:35] Okay, three. I make all my involves
[27:38] every single one. That's not good.
[27:42] Lieutenant does one damage to the
[27:44] Thunderhammer Terminator Squad. Ballistus Dreadnought
[27:46] Dreadnought on Victric Honor Guard attack.
[27:48] Zero command point spend for armor of
[27:50] content thanks to Roboute Guilliman. An actual
[27:51] command point spend to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll] a save.
[27:53] Ah, kills him.
[27:54] >> Vicri honor guard lose one model only.
[27:58] >> So I'm going to clap back with the
[28:00] >> lightning cloud terminator squad squad and the
[28:02] chaplet attacking Hellre and his
[28:04] crusaders. The crusaders are down. Hell
[28:07] is unharmed. Redemptor's dread now into
[28:09] the last terminator squad. It
[28:11] lives tax spending a command point on
[28:12] that terminator squad. Heroes of the Chapter.
[28:14] That's going to give him a bonus to hit
[28:16] and wound into the lieutenant.
[28:19] I rolled them once and then I do wound
[28:21] you. I'm safe.
[28:23] >> STILL NO DAMAGE DEALT. Hell kills the
[28:26] last lightning claw. Terminator Squad.
[28:28] Gullerman on the The Emperor's Champion
[28:30] parries his one failed save away.
[28:33] Blanked it.
[28:33] >> That was really, really lackluster.
[28:35] >> Victory Guard into the Emperor's
[28:37] Champion.
[28:41] >> Three AP. So fours.
[28:44] >> And he picks him up. That's huge.
[28:47] >> It's okay. He's completely blocking you
[28:48] from getting the objective though, so
[28:50] that's good. Tack also picks up a scout
[28:51] squad at the end of the phase to come
[28:52] back from reserves. That is a big big
[28:54] turn. Four points on display of might
[28:56] for Mitchell. He discards defense
[28:58] stronghold to gain a command point. He
[29:00] also has two points on [OBJECTIVE:Terraform] to give
[29:02] himself 18 on that turn to go to 26.
[29:04] Tack has another [OBJECTIVE:Terraform] point. Ticks
[29:06] him up to 28. Two points in it at the
[29:08] start of round four.
[29:22] I've got one command point. You've got
[29:23] two command points. And then in terms of
[29:25] secondaries,
[29:25] >> defense stronghold is added to bring it
[29:27] down.
[29:28] >> Cool.
[29:28] >> Oath Target number one is the sword
[29:30] brethren. Oath Target number two is the
[29:32] redemptor dreadnought. Command Point for
[29:34] [STRATAGEM:Insane Bravery] here to make sure his
[29:36] terminator squad passes.
[29:37] >> Worth way too many points.
[29:38] >> And his victory guard also pass. Tackles
[29:40] two objectives for four each. That's a
[29:42] total of eight primary taking him up to
[29:44] 36. Okay. And then we move on to the
[29:46] movement phase.
[29:47] >> Bladeguard Veteran Squad shuffle to make
[29:48] room for the sternguard veteran squad. Sternguard Veteran Squad
[29:50] and Tyarius move up beside those blade
[29:52] guard. Oh boy.
[29:53] >> So they can now all see.
[29:55] >> Terminator Squad chaplain falls back onto the
[29:57] objective. Assault. Terminator Squad falls
[29:59] back into cover. Scout Squad watch out
[30:01] from reserves onto Mitchell's home
[30:03] objective. I'm so upset.
[30:05] >> So here we go. We're going to go into
[30:07] the uh shooting phase.
[30:09] >> Sergy is opening up into the sword
[30:11] brethren. Heroes with the chapter for
[30:12] zero command points. Thanks to Gullin,
[30:14] Mitchell responds with armor of contempt
[30:16] for a command point. Tigurius using the
[30:17] focus witchfire profile, risking the
[30:19] hazardous task. Mitchell a command point
[30:21] on fueled by wrath to feel no pain the
[30:23] mortal wounds he's about to take. The
[30:25] sword brethren and the castellan die. The
[30:28] marshal's unwounded.
[30:29] >> So that's a character kill.
[30:31] >> Gleam at the marshal no effect. Blaard
[30:34] and judiciar split fire into the
[30:36] marshal and the intercessor squad. No damage
[30:38] to either.
[30:39] >> Okay, good talk. So now the eradicator squad
[30:41] have to go into your dreadnought. The
[30:43] regular mouses I did not move. So they
[30:46] both hit fives. There's one
[30:49] >> only one.
[30:50] >> Five up.
[30:52] >> No, they caught him. Blow up.
[30:55] >> Kaboom. IT BLOWS UP.
[30:58] >> OH NO.
[31:01] >> Terminator Squad takes one mortal wound. He's
[31:04] on a wound remaining. Chaplan takes a
[31:05] mortal wound. He's got two left.
[31:07] Lieutenant takes three mortal wounds.
[31:09] HE'S GOT ONE WOUND REMAINING. I THINK
[31:11] THE Redemptor did more damage there than
[31:13] it did all game. Ouch. Kabibble.
[31:16] >> That was awesome. That was great.
[31:18] >> Scouts are terraforming Mitchell's home
[31:20] objective.
[31:22] >> So charge number one is
[31:25] >> Victrix charging the Bertalis dreadnought.
[31:28] They're in. Gullin charges the ballistus dreadnought.
[31:30] He's in. Eradicator squad charging the
[31:33] lieutenant fails. Bladeguard Veteran Squad reach the
[31:36] intercessor squad.
[31:37] You don't have command points to
[31:38] interrupt, so I'm just going to go.
[31:40] >> Bladeguard Veteran Squad choosing to [STRATAGEM:Command Re-roll]
[31:41] ones to hit this fight phase. Oh, the
[31:43] bladeguard veteran squad have picked up the
[31:44] intercessor squad and consolidated onto the
[31:46] center objective. Roboute Guilliman takes down the
[31:48] ballistus dreadnought.
[31:51] Consolidation move puts him on the
[31:52] objective.
[31:53] >> You feeling okay? I'm scared.
[31:56] >> Big big turn from Tac. T's got four

[37:40] three points on behind enemy lines. T
[37:42] got 23 secondary. He's at 45 primary as
[37:46] well. That's going to take him to 68.
[37:47] Mitchell does get two more [OBJECTIVE:Terraform] to
[37:49] take him to 35. Does he have enough here
[37:51] to catch up?
[37:55] >> Draw my secondaries and see what
[37:57] happens.

[38:15] primary with his primary and [OBJECTIVE:Terraform].

[38:31] >> And with that, Mitchell has not won this
[38:33] game. has not got the paint studio. But
[38:36] we'll find another way for it to happen.
